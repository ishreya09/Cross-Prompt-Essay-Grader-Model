So i logged into my laptop and went on google, within seconds the definitions wore popping onto my screen like pop rocks. After I found out what the words meant, I finished my homework in about five minutes. Without the internet I don't know how long it would have taken.

But is it holding me back from more important things? I think so. I feel that not having computers will in a way educate people more so than now. For example with school research papers we imediatly go to the computers in order to find information when we could be using books and magazeens. With having the use of computers many people don't properly know how to use and find information in books. Also being around computers and using them so much is pulling families further apart and stopping humans from being more interactive with nature and the environment. For many people using a computer is a life style, it's something we tend to use more than religiously and that @MONTH1 not be the best thing. Children, teens and even adults get extremly addicted to computers. Teens and children use laptops and @CAPS1's everyday in order to do their school work, and to talk with friends. As well as parents/adults, they use it to get their work done and use it as a easy communication with co-workers. To this very day people have become very addicted to computers. I know for certain that in my family, my mother, nor my father, nor my brother, nor I could go through a day without using a computer. As I mentioned before computers are also pulling families further apart. There is less family time and comunication between family members these days, due to computers. Insead of spending time with the family, teens prefer spending time on the computer chatting with their friends. I bet if there was a poll was taken on how much family time has been taken away in households because of computers I almost garentee it would be quite a large amount. I know the only true family time some families have without computers is dinner and that isn't much. Lastly many humans are not as connected to nature and as involved as they used to be. Using computer keeps people inside and not exposed to nature. Though there many advertisements and pop ups on the computer that inform us about how to take care of the earth properly, we so easily ignore them and remain playing on the computer than going outside and doing something to help make the world a better, clearer place. Not only is it just taking care of our earth, but it is also the fact that not many people these days go out and get the fresh air they need as much as they really should. Most likely not all of that is due to the use of computers, but I bet a great deal of it is. Like I said before it is super hard to imagine a day without a computer, I mean how would we communicate or do our work? But there are trulthfully other ways to do them that we just aren't very used to because of the fact that we are so attatched to them. I never really noticed till now that it is possible to live without a computer, and that so many people are missing increadable things such as family and nature because we are so addicted to the computers.\"\nEssay Prompt: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society.

The content is stronger than in the first essay, and it raises valid concerns about internet usage. The points about online safety and misinformation are well-founded, but the examples could be more detailed and supported by stronger evidence. For example, the mention of a friend's experience with online stalking could be explained more clearly to show how this issue impacts real-life situations. While the essay addresses important issues, the organization could be improved. The ideas feel somewhat disjointed, with some abrupt shifts between topics. The essay also contains several grammatical and spelling errors, such as \"comperters\" instead of \"computers,\" and inconsistent capitalization.

Computers just don't take your time they help you understand the menning of a family.These are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture. There are many people that like to explore and see new places, but they can't because maybe they just don't have time or they might have to much work. There is no exception for someone to not put their oportunities out, just because they don't have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you that work in a office need information about a place that a disaster happened. You might need somenthing to see how it happen and @CAPS1 was the condition it happend.

Not just that but, you can find at how much something is at a store and if it is on sale or not. These are just some of the great effects computers have on people. However, work is a really large effect computers have on people. For example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because their are many stores you get to choose from. To go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on word if its for a report for work or an essay in school. Maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper. Yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is comunicate with their friends. Most kids either use facebook, @CAPS2, or oovoo to comunicate. Having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away.

Word choice is generally simple but occasionally unclear, especially in phrases like \"computers benefit society today\" and \"computers make work easier.\" Sentence fluency is hindered by repetitive structures and awkward phrasing, which detract from readability. Conventions are inconsistently followed, with noticeable issues in punctuation and spelling, such as the misuse of apostrophes in \"computer's.\" The essay adheres to the prompt but could benefit from a more focused exploration of the topic. Language use is functional but could be more polished to enhance clarity. Narrativity is present in the anecdotes, but these examples need more detail to become compelling. Overall, the essay communicates its point but would benefit from stronger coherence, precision in language, and more attention to grammatical detail."}]}

People are gaining weight, which is already a problem in the @LOCATION1 because of unnecissary technology. There are plenty of sports that could be done, such as soccer, baseball, football, and so many more. People seemed to manage fine without computers and were a lot more active before them.

People spend too much time looking up beautiful place and animals when they could easily go explore around outside! Take a walk by the forest or in a local park, even by the beach and you'll see loads of animals. Not to mention, the immense amount of different plants and flowers they have never noticed right behind their very own home! No computers and people could quickly start enjoying nature more often.

The content touches on important issues, but lacks depth in places, requiring further elaboration to provide a stronger argument. The organization is somewhat unclear, with abrupt transitions that disrupt the flow.

The three reasons I think this, is because computers enhance our hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic. They also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. Computers, in fact, increase our hand-eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allow us to look only at tha sceen while typing on the keyboard. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have when excersising by playing sports or working out, which is also important and very good for our bodies. If you want in to apply for a job in, for example, an office, and you started stumbling and acting clumsy, then you @MONTH1 be looked at differently if you were organized and knew what your doing. This is why hand-eye coordination is important to people. Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, In fifth grade I did a research project on @LOCATION2. Without all the useful information I found on the computer. I would have never been able to learn evrything I did. As most of the world already knows, there was a devestating earthquake in the small country of @LOCATION4. Computers was one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims. Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the help on the computer. They could buy flight tickets, book a room at the hotel, and even get a rental car for when they land. This is what my family did on our vacation to @LOCATION1 and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rareley ever see. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION3, so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them one every two or three years. Also when my dad goes on buisness trips to other states or even something out of the country, we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch. Lastly, if you have friends or family who are fighting for america in @LOCATION5 right now, you can also use a video chat to communicate with them. So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They help with hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet, and lastly, the allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today.\"\nEssay Prompt: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society.

But could it be a bad thing. The computer is one of the top uses by @CAPS2, but I think we spend a little to much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend to much time on it, cant interact with friends or family and you cant enjoy nature. Dont get me wrong, its nice to meet new people on the internet and learn about other places. But when are you going to get your exercis of your on it for @NUM1 hours? Sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You cant get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Instead up being blinded by the screen, you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your @CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, (than to sit) is going out for a run. Kids need about @NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs than your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishies will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all wont you miss your friends? At this age kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air. If you havent visted the park in a while it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. Your getting exercise & exploring nature too. While your at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, your buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just dont spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand.

The content is relevant, but it lacks clarity in its argumentation. The points made are somewhat disorganized, and there is a tendency to repeat ideas in a way that weakens the overall message. For instance, the writer discusses the effects on the eyes and body in a similar manner without clearly distinguishing between the two. To improve the content, try providing more detailed examples and focusing on a clear progression of ideas. The organization of the essay needs significant improvement. The ideas do not follow a logical order, and the transitions between points are abrupt. Grouping related concepts together and adding transition sentences would make the essay flow better. The word choice here is limited and sometimes incorrect, such as \"blive\" instead of \"believe,\" and \"exersice\" instead of \"exercise.\" A stronger vocabulary would help clarify the writer\u2019s intent and make the essay more convincing. In terms of sentence fluency, while some sentences are understandable, others feel disjointed or overly simplistic. Try to vary sentence length and structure for a smoother, more engaging narrative. There are numerous grammatical issues, such as incorrect verb forms (\"you woudnt\" instead of \"you wouldn't\"), spelling errors, and punctuation mistakes.

The content is relevant, with personal examples such as the writer\u2019s experience with international communication and the practical use of computers for travel planning and school projects. However, the essay would benefit from a deeper exploration of the potential negative aspects of computer use to present a more balanced view. The organization is fairly solid, but more structured paragraphs and smoother transitions between ideas would enhance the clarity of the argument. Word choice is adequate, but there is room for improvement in precision and variety to make the essay more engaging and professional. Sentence fluency is generally okay but could be improved by varying sentence structure and eliminating repetitive phrases to maintain the reader\u2019s interest. Conventions are generally followed, though there are a few minor errors in spelling and punctuation that could be addressed to improve the overall readability. The essay adheres to the prompt well and stays on topic throughout, but a more polished presentation with attention to detail would make the argument stronger."}]}

For example, while mentioning that you can \"look up anything,\" the essay does not provide specific examples or elaborate on how this is beneficial.

The content addresses important concerns but is very underdeveloped, making many points feel overly simplistic. The organization is weak, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion, and transitions between ideas are nearly nonexistent. Word choice is poor, with many spelling errors and awkward phrasing, which makes the essay hard to read. Sentence fluency is lacking, as many sentences are short and choppy, which diminishes the essay's flow. Conventions are not properly followed, with consistent issues in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. The essay does not fully address the prompt and would benefit from more specific examples and a deeper analysis of the claims made. The language is overly simplistic, and the narrative lacks engagement due to a lack of descriptive detail or compelling argumentation. Overall, the essay presents some relevant concerns but needs major improvements in structure, language, and detail to be effective."}]}

Well no more! Since the computer was invented there have been many many advancements and all of those things are gone. There was once a time when the only way to do a project on a country was to look in the paper untill you found something now with computer advancements you can enter a country's came into google, a search site, and up comes @NUM1 things on that country. In fact @PERSON1 a expert on computers and inventor of one of the most advanced computers on earth says that searching for information is now @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 eisier depending on the topic. Also you no longer have to work a redundunt type write that always makes mistakes that you have to retype. You can just use @ORGANIZATION1 and you type your essay. Anything speelled wrong is underlined in red so you only rarely have a spelling mistake. As a result of this increase in knolage, from a learning stand point computers are extremly good for mankind. My second reason that computers are extremely good for us is that they are entertaining. On your new laptop you can go on miniclip or addicting games, both gaming websites and play games. These game while not only are fun improve handeye coordination which helps with sports, driving, writirs and many other things. More advanced gaming computers called consoles such as the @CAPS2-box @NUM2, by @ORGANIZATION1, the @NUM3, the @CAPS3 by the @CAPS4 provide exteme gaming experience. One of the more recent games for these consoles is called @CAPS5 of @CAPS6! Modern @CAPS7 @NUM4. This game has an online system where you can talk to and play against people all around the world. Not only that but advanced games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 improve eyesight. Studies show that playing a high action game @NUM4 hrs a day will improve eyesight more than eating @NUM6 serving carrots a day. My final reason that computers are good for you is that they take boring waits. If you've everyone to @CAPS10 you know that the lime can be @NUM4 hrs long. People used to wait that just standing there. Now people can pull out their @CAPS11 or @NUM8 player and listen to music. The @CAPS11 can take videos and pictures as well as play music, videos and games. If you are lucky enough to have an I touch you can check email, stocks, weather and news right on your @CAPS13 as well as buy songs which can be @NUM9 cheaper than @CAPS14.

The content is opinion-driven, but the points are not fully explored, leaving many arguments underdeveloped. The essay\u2019s organization is quite weak, with ideas presented in a somewhat haphazard manner, making it difficult to follow the flow of the argument. Word choice is often imprecise, and the frequent use of vague terms detracts from the clarity of the essay. Sentence fluency is problematic, as many sentences are awkwardly structured or incomplete, which affects the readability and coherence of the essay. The conventions are poorly followed, with multiple spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors that hinder the overall quality of the piece. The essay\u2019s adherence to the prompt is inconsistent, as it focuses more on the negative impacts of computers without offering a balanced view. To improve, the essay would need clearer structure, better argument development, and careful attention to conventions.

Computers seem to be the talk of the year. Many people believe that computers are needed for everyday life, but I would have to disagree. In my opinion we do not need computers. The effects computers have on kids and adults are astonishing. Humans today are not spending as much time in nature and excirsising for a healthy body and a healthy planet. Also, as us kids are growing up, we have too many advantages because of computers. Thirdly, so much money is being used towards computers and not whats truely important! As you can see these three reasons alone should persuade anyone to believe that computers are harmful to all areas of life. First off, as we continue to use computers our natural environment is going to waste. The effects on nature and people are horrible. Polution is being spread all over the planet! People are becoming addicted to computers. I know it will surprise you when I tell you that the average person spends about ten hours on a computer a day! This is about half the day! This is a terrifying effect on people, because now these computers are brain washing us! Instead of going on the computer all day, we should be going outside to enjoy fresh air and the sun. Their the more, computers have us sitting inside all day and not getting any excirsive, which is a health issue we need to learn about the little things and be thankful for what we already have! Consiquently, banning computers would have a positive effect. Today, many are loosing their ability to write card forgetting about the simple things life has to offer would writing an essay with a pencil and paper be so bad? This @MONTH1 be old fashioned, but there are an enormous amount of great effects for using pen and paper. Maybe, the @ORGANIZATION2 states would become smarter and contain more knowledge. By writing everything out is proven to help remember important facts easier and for a longer amount of time, writing on paper is like writing it in you brain. Therefore, students, children and adults would benefit by having better handwriting. Since most information is typed on the computer people are forgetting how to write neatly, clearly, and resonsibly. @PERSON1 is an english teacher that has been with the @ORGANIZATION1 school since before computers, she has seen the horrible effects taking place on her students right befor her eyes. @PERSON1 told me, \"\"@CAPS1, students are completely absorbed in computers and have no life, energy, or reativeness in them anymore! Kids have too many advantages with computers and not taking the time. Last, but most definetley not least is my third reason as to computers are effecting humans negetively. Humans are sending huge amounts of money on getting the latest computer technology. Most of people pay chedes are being used for their computers. These fancey computers are very expensive, but also very useless. In my opinion many people are just following a trend. Instead, the money can be spent on schools, and especially the wars! Do you hear the humming of the computer the clicking of the buttons? Realize that these sounds are not what you should be spending! To wrap it up, computers effect people. There are many reasons to support this, but here are three. One is that people are not spending any time in nature! Another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic and not spending the time to learn things in quality. Thirdly, people are using all there money on those computers! I know some people think computers are very usefull,but I know now, after you have read this article, you know how unuseful computers really are.\"\nEssay Prompt: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society.

The content touches on several important issues, but the argument lacks depth and support. For instance, while the essay mentions pollution and addiction, these points are not sufficiently explained or backed by data or examples. The organization of the essay is clear, with distinct sections for each argument, but there are frequent spelling and grammar errors that hinder readability (e.g., \"excirsize\" should be \"exercise,\" \"truely\" should be \"truly\"). The use of the exclamation mark in the introduction is overdone and may detract from the seriousness of the argument. The essay would benefit from a more balanced approach, providing counterarguments to strengthen its position and clearer, more specific examples to back up its claims. Additionally, the sentences are somewhat repetitive, and the essay\u2019s conclusion feels abrupt. More refinement in language and structure would improve the overall quality."}]}

While the essay addresses several key points, the development of ideas could be improved. For example, the section on research could use more concrete examples, like how specific databases or search engines provide information. The explanation of communication through email and video chat is helpful, but it would benefit from more detailed examples or elaboration on how these forms of communication have transformed modern life. The essay's structure is relatively clear, though some transitions between ideas feel abrupt, and certain phrases are awkwardly constructed, such as \"computers are like digital encyclopedias.\" Additionally, there are numerous issues with spelling and grammar, including improper capitalization and typos like \"betters\" instead of \"betters.\" Clarifying these ideas and refining sentence structure would improve the essay significantly."}]}

She went to the doctors and they told her that she had to give up the computer and play with it for only two days a week for five hours only. She listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun @CAPS2 she used to be. Being on the computer too much can harm you and the people around you.

On the hand, I believe the computers put positive effects on people. First of all, they are a great way for kids to have fun: @CAPS1, people can learn very interesting facts. Lastly, it is a great way to communicate with friends and family. These are a few reasons I think computers put a positive effect on people. To begin with on a computer you can have a lot of fun by playing games. The computer saves money for a lot of us. For example, if you bought a game system it would cost well over @MONEY1 but on a computor you can find and play games for free. Not all games have to be like \"\"@CAPS2 of @CAPS3\"\" or \"\"@CAPS2 of @CAPS5\"\" they can be games about sports. Supose one student broke his leg and he love playing soccer. He could just on the computer and play a game of soccer even though he has a broken leg. People can @CAPS1 learn various facts right from their computers. The most important thing that computors are made for is to learn new things. No one in the @CAPS2 knows everything, but if every one put what they know into the computer than people can get learne any thing from them, I remember @CAPS6 my friend once told me about some guy named @PERSON2. I had no idea who he was so my friend started laughing at me, @CAPS6 I got home I searched him up and by the time I was done reading about him I knew more than my friend about @PERSON2. If he ever have a question in class and our teacher can't answer it he/she always tells us to either \"\"@CAPS7\"\" it or \"\"@CAPS8\"\" it. They both are search engines. Not only can you learn a lot from computers you can @CAPS1 communicate with people from different countries. What if @PERSON1 did not invent the telephone? How different would our life be me right now? Anyway most people use the computer to communicate nowadays. Whether it @CAPS9 or @CAPS10, or whether its @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS11 all are a great way to communicate with people. With tele phones it costs money to talk with people in a different country, but with the roputer it is absolutely freen. You could be living in @LOCATION1 and chatting with someone in @LOCATION5. You could live in @LOCATION2 and email someone in @LOCATION3. Communication every where is fast and easy with the computer. My whole family lives in @LOCATION6 and it costs us twice as much to make a call there. @CAPS6 we use the computer it is even better because they can even see our fare throught the webcam. As you can see, computers are not negitive at all for all I know is that help people around the @CAPS2. They help kids have fun with the games we can play. @CAPS1, it teaches children and adults various now things. Lastly, it is a great communication strategy.

You can go there to learn and to do research if you have to write a paper. You can rent movies, music, and books at your pleasure as long as you take care of them. Also, if you're just having a hectic day and need some peace and quiet, libraries become a perfect get away. But, heres the truth. Many people find certain things in libraries to be offensive and would rather them not be on the shevles. So, do we remove these things or let them stay?     My opinion is to let them stay. I believe that books are too important to throw out just because they @MONTH1 contain a few vulgar words or images. It's the same with magazines and movies. Also, music is changing as the years go on and many people, especially elders, don't enjoy listening to this new style of music. Just because one person my find something offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will.     People have many different views when it comes to these things. Take history for example. Many history books contain harsh, real life facts about things that went on in the past. A song, book, or movie about slavery can cause some people to be offended. Whether it's because the person opposes slavery greatly or they believe that slavery was a good thing, people have different feelings towards it. Another good example is movies. Some people @MONTH1 find a movie offensive because of words said or if a certain person dies first, while others could care less.      Additionally, many things that are found offensive to one person can make something more interesting to someone else. There are many movies nowdays that can be seen as very offensive. But honestly, the offensive things happening @MONTH1 just make someone else want to know more about what's going on. It is practically the same with books. I myself have read plenty of things that would make some people cry or even get really mad or disgusted. Even though in the end, I lfind them to be exceptionally books. It just on how you view it.     So, should things that are found offensive to one person be removed from a library? The answer is no. There are just too many things that can be taken offensively. If you start taking away these things, libraries are only going to become vacant. Younger people will stop coming because materials will be less interesting. You will lose artifacts and stories about the history of the world. There will also only be so many books to read, if ever a non-offensive book could even be found. My advise to libraries, keep materials that can be found extremely offensive in their own area, away from younger people who @MONTH1 react strongly. Maybe even put a sticker on the book, if possible, letting people know just what they're dealing with\"\nEssay Prompt: Censorship in the Libraries.

However, the overall effectiveness is significantly hampered by numerous issues. The content lacks depth and clarity; the arguments presented are vague and not sufficiently developed. For instance, while you mention that people should be allowed to read whatever they want, you do not provide specific examples or reasoning to support this viewpoint. The organization is very weak, with a lack of clear structure or logical flow; ideas seem to be presented in a random order, making it difficult for readers to follow your argument.

The content lacks clarity and coherence; the narrative is disjointed and difficult to follow, with insufficient context provided for the events described.

Additionally, there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors, such as \"libary\" instead of \"library,\" \"beet\" instead of \"beat,\" and \"thow up\" instead of \"throw up,\" which detract from the professionalism of the writing.

The organization is also lacking; there is no clear introduction or conclusion, and ideas are not logically sequenced, making it hard for readers to grasp the overall message. To improve this essay, the author should focus on creating a clear thesis statement that outlines the main points of discussion. Each paragraph should be structured around a single idea with appropriate transitions to guide readers through the narrative.

The writer expresses genuine concern about the impact of explicit media on young viewers, emphasizing the responsibility of adults in controlling content exposure.

The overall organization is somewhat unclear, as thoughts jump between ideas without smooth transitions. Suggestions for improvement include structuring the argument more logically, possibly by introducing the problem, explaining the impact on children, and then proposing solutions. In terms of word choice, the vocabulary is quite basic, and enhancing this with more precise words would help convey the argument more powerfully. Sentence fluency could also be improved by varying sentence structures and avoiding repetition. Additionally, grammatical errors, including misspellings and misuse of words (e.g., \"wemon\" instead of \"women\" and \"childern\" instead of \"children\"), distract from the message, so careful proofreading is recommended. The essay\u2019s adherence to the prompt is clear, as it discusses media restrictions for children, though a more balanced viewpoint could improve engagement.

Everyone has different taste in movies, music, books, etc. If the music offends you, don't listen to @CAPS2. If a book does, don't read @CAPS2. Its as simple as that. So I don't think they should remove the books, music, movies, etc. That could offend someone, and here are my reason why;          If you were to remove all the things that might interest the people now a-day, then you wouldn't have anything that entertains the kids instead of them going out and getting in trouble, I believe every person has the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever @CAPS2 is they want to listen to. Also If they find @CAPS2 offensive then they just shouldn't listen that song, watch that movie, or even read the book or magazines. Everyones offended in different ways from another, So we can't help @CAPS2 if @CAPS3 little book, song, etc., offends a person.          I also think if you give a kid the chance to read @CAPS2, and he sees how offensive @CAPS2 might be, @CAPS2 might keep him/her from doing some of the things he might do if he didn't read the book, Also if he watches what movies he wants, he will learn that, @CAPS1 every body is good people. Children read in a wide variety, some read there dr.suess books and other could be reading @PERSON1 '@CAPS2'. Depending on the children they should be able to choose what they read, listen to or watch. The only flaw I find about Children down side to some magazines is the fact almost every magazine has atleast @CAPS3 half naked women, or man in @CAPS2. Children in there @ORGANIZATION1 years through about first year of @ORGANIZATION2 should @CAPS1 have to see that.          My @CAPS4 reason is, people have many different tastes in the materials, so I believe they can read what they want as long as @CAPS2 does @CAPS1 offend them. What there reading should @CAPS1 have any effect on others unless they are reading @CAPS2 also. There are so many people that get offended by the littlest things, but they don't see that its life they will get offended more than a hand full of times in there life.           In conflusion I think that people should be able to read what they want even the books people find offensive. The offensive things Should @CAPS1 be taken off the shelves. I also feel that if children get to read some things that could be offensive then they will understand the fact that life isn't easy and you will end up being offended. Also that @CAPS1 everyone is good people, and things happen that people don't like but its life. Finally I think people should @CAPS1 have to give up reading, listening to, watching or looking at things that @MONTH1 be interesting to them\"\nEssay Prompt: Censorship in the Libraries.

The author suggests that if something offends an individual, they should simply avoid it rather than removing it from public access. While the essay presents a valid point about personal choice in media consumption, it is hindered by significant weaknesses in several areas. The content lacks depth and specificity; the arguments presented are repetitive and could benefit from more concrete examples to illustrate how exposure to diverse materials can foster understanding and critical thinking. The organization is also weak, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes it difficult for readers to follow the argument's progression. Additionally, word choice is often imprecise and informal, which detracts from the overall seriousness of the argument; phrases like \"the libraries fault\" and \"the beauty in impurity\" are unclear and could be articulated more effectively. Sentence fluency is inconsistent, with awkward constructions and overly long sentences affecting readability. Furthermore, there are numerous grammatical errors throughout the essay that distract from its professionalism. To improve this piece, the author should focus on developing each point with specific examples and clearer explanations while organizing thoughts into distinct paragraphs with clear topic sentences. Refining word choice for precision and correcting grammatical errors will significantly enhance the overall quality of writing. By addressing these areas for improvement, the essay can more effectively communicate its message about the importance of preserving diverse materials in libraries while fostering critical thought among readers."}]}

This perspective demonstrates an understanding of individual rights and freedom of expression, an important consideration in this debate. However, the content lacks depth, as it could benefit from specific examples or additional arguments to support this stance. The organization is weak, with ideas that feel disjointed and need more logical flow between sentences. Improving transition words and restructuring the essay to introduce, elaborate on, and conclude the main argument would create a more coherent presentation. The vocabulary used is simple, and more precise, impactful words could enhance the message.

However this in not the @DATE1, women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not dillouted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet. So is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault, for not educating their children on the morality of such items?     The modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses. Movies over @CAPS2 attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children. So how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read,watch or hear them. Plus libraries generally don't let young kids check out @CAPS3 rated movies or parental advisory @CAPS4.     Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults. As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teens mind over the course of @NUM1 pages till parents end up with an anti-sematic teen with bad view on racism. So then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents.     So if you find materials at a library offensive, or worry about your child going there, there's always an easy solution. Don't go their and don't let your child go their.

It begins with historical references to censorship, such as the removal of statues and book burnings, which effectively contextualizes the discussion. However, while the author raises important points about the role of libraries in providing diverse materials and the responsibility of parents to educate their children, the content lacks depth and specificity. For instance, the claim that libraries cater to specific demographics is made without concrete examples or data to support it. The organization is weak, with ideas presented in a scattered manner and lacking clear transitions, making it difficult for readers to follow the argument's progression. Word choice is often imprecise and informal, undermining the seriousness of the argument; phrases like \"the libraries fault\" and \"the beauty in impurity\" are unclear. Additionally, sentence fluency suffers from awkward constructions and overly long sentences that affect readability. There are also numerous grammatical errors throughout the essay, including punctuation mistakes that detract from its professionalism. To strengthen this essay, the author should develop each point with specific examples and clearer explanations while organizing thoughts into distinct paragraphs with clear topic sentences. Refining word choice for precision and correcting grammatical errors will significantly enhance the overall quality of writing. By addressing these areas for improvement, the essay can more effectively communicate its message about the importance of preserving diverse materials in libraries while fostering critical thought among readers."}]}

So it makes it hard upon the student who is trying to do a report.

It is unfair they have to worry will have the materials they need for them to sucess and do their term paper.      I think if the schools took time out and got parnets involed.

The author expresses frustration over the situation, noting that many students forget to return their materials or simply do not want to do so, which creates challenges for others trying to complete reports. While the topic is relevant, the essay suffers from numerous critical weaknesses that significantly hinder its effectiveness. The content lacks clarity and depth; while it raises valid points about the consequences of not returning library materials, it could benefit from more specific examples and a clearer articulation of the problem.

You look at her, she looks at you, she walks away. You go and pick up the book, @CAPS4's about medical marijuana. She took offense to that? I don't really care what people gotta say, if @CAPS4's on the shelf, @CAPS4 stays on the shelf.     I'm convincing librarians, readers, and everyone else that if you have offense to a book, magazine, movie, or anything you can find at a @CAPS1 library, shut your fat mouths. A library serves many purposes, one, @CAPS4's @CAPS1, itt's open to anyone and everyone. Two, if you have a library card, you can check out books, movies, music, etc. Three, if your walking down the road and 'gotta go,' you can stop right in and leave.      What I'm trying to say is that nothing should be removed from any shelf at any library. Yeah, I mean there's a certain point at which you got to take charge, but even then you can have an adolescent room or what not. I think that if you take something off the shelf at a library, you can just taking away part of the heart. Let's say you have @NUM1 @CAPS1 libraries in your town, one library has one thing the other doesn't have. Someone riots and they get to take @CAPS4 off the shelf. Your never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy @CAPS4 off line. And sometimes, that can get a little pricey, especially since you can get @CAPS4 free at a library?      But then again, I see where people are coming from to take certain materials off the shelfs. Say you gotta @NUM2-year old kid, and he walks up to you carrying a sex love book. What can you say about that? I mean in sounds corny but @CAPS4 can happen. Most parents just want to keep their kids in a safe, harmless enviroment. That's where they come in and say, 'I thought this was a @CAPS1 library?!' Then that's where @CAPS4 goes bad.      After all that happens, people just accuse the librarians to @CAPS2 they got these books, movies, and music that's just bad for a young kid. But @CAPS4's not the librarians' fault, different people like different books, that's @CAPS2 a library has many, many choices when @CAPS4 comes to books.      That's when the question comes up, '@CAPS2 don't we just have seperate rooms, for seperate books?' @CAPS3, that sounds good and all, but who's gonna pay for @CAPS4? Libraries get donated alot of their stuff, they are profitable, but then again a non-profitable resource. Libraries have been around for ages, most of them started out small and now are big. That's when the library gets donations, looks through them, and sells the books they don't want or need. They make money off that, that's when they start making seperate rooms.     @CAPS4 sounds crazy, but @CAPS4 wouldn't cause a riot to go on about people. Therefore, people are happy, librarians happy, and most of all you are happy. You can find the book you want or need easy as one, two, three. All you gotta do is go to that certain room, look for @CAPS4, check @CAPS4 out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime. @CAPS4 sounds easier that looking @CAPS4 up, get the dewy decimal number, find the number.      All in all, we shouldn't remove anything from a library shelf bevause @CAPS4 @MONTH1 be the only one in your town, maybe the only one in your state, maybe through the whole country. You never know.

Censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer.  Some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material. Others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please. Censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own.     In @DATE1's society, there are no limits. The human imagination can create beautiful works of literary art and music, but it can also create material not suitable for every age group. Library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes. However, what @MONTH1 be unacceptable for children to view @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for a mature adult. Censorship is purely opinion. If a person is a strict believer that @CAPS1 created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution. If a parent does not want their child to watch @CAPS2, they would rather their children not see a @CAPS2 disk in the children's section for their child to see. If one person harbors a profound grudge against @CAPS4, it is unfair to others if all @CAPS5 content is removed from a library's shelves. If a person does not wish to have access to certain 'offensive' subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to it. But it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who @MONTH1 wish to educate themselves on the said matters.     Writing is a form of self- expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. It is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past. But if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community? It is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content. If books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed, then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well. Eventually, there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another. That is one of the beauties of being an @CAPS6 citizen: freedom of speech. By living in @LOCATION1, one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please. Censorship prevents learning from those who want it.     Parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship. Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the @CAPS7 era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it. Children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage open- mindedness and acceptance of others. Libraries provide a source by which young people can educate themselves on the religions, beliefs, and customs of the outside world. It should not be up to the parents to decide what is put on the library shelves; if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library.      In conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion. Citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please. Granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unaccepable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning. Freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. As Katherine Paterson once said, '...

So if they're taking books off the shelve because they find them offensive, then there will be so many books gone, that the kids will not have a broder view as so many people are lucky to have today.     Everyone has a different oppinion about everything, including what's offensive and what's not. If one person see's a book as being offensive, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone else will also. I've heard of teachers not letting the students see pictures of The @CAPS1, because the think it's offensive. Not everyone agrees with that. The @CAPS1 is a big part in history and it being catorgorized as offensive is wrong, it's not the only thing in history that is bad. If they start taking out big parts of history, it will be long lost and forgotten.     Lastly i believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read. We have the right to choose what we want to read, if we think that it's bad and shouldn't be reading it, then we won't read it. But that doesn't mean they should take out the book because one person finds it offesive. Someone else might want to read it. I think that people are mature enough to pick what they read, and as for children their parents are the one's that could pick for them.     With so many different oppinions it's hard to decide what to do about censorship, I believe that if it's offensive maybe they should have a special section for explicit media and reading. Maybe then people wouldn't be offended by it. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean another wouldn't either.\"\nEssay Prompt: Censorship in the Libraries.

However, while the essay presents valid points, it suffers from several weaknesses. The content could benefit from more specific examples to illustrate how censorship affects access to important historical materials, as well as a clearer explanation of the implications of removing such content.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Essay: \"Books have been apart of every single person's life as soon as they learn to read. First our parents read us books to get us to go to sleep. Then our teachers read us books to teach us things or to keep us preoccupied. Then, when we get a little older, we are assigned to read books for classes. There is even reading in the workplace, whether it be reciepts or orders or recipes. Readings is something that we cannot get away from. This leads me to say that authors write books for an audience and write the book as best they can to atrract the attention of the audience. I do not believe that books, regardless if one person deems them offensive, should be removed from the shelf that they have been placed on. I think that there are things we can do if we do not want to read that particular book. There are also things parents can do to ensure that the books their children are reading are appropriate and not offensive. Also there are advantages to reading books that @MONTH1 show something different that that person @MONTH1 have experienced before.     First, I feel that books should not be removed from libraries because some people think that they are offensive. Everyone has an opinion and just because one person does not like the book, should not mean that the experience of reading that book should be taken away from someone else. If you find a book to be offensive, you can simply stop reading the book. Just because you do not enjoy it does not mean someone else will not also. That is just apart of humans having their own opinions.     On a different note, I think that childrens' books are a little bit different. Parents have the right and responsibility to protect their children. I believe that parents should take a proactive role in monitoring their children. For young children, I think that parents should just read the book first and judge whether or not they think they're child should read it. Then for young adults, I think that parents could try to look up somethings about the book. The internet is a great source for reviews and ratings of books. Therefore, I believe that censorship for childrens' books is a responsibilty of the parent.     Lastly, I think books that are different to everyone and can be interpreted differently. When I read a book, think about the scheme, imagine the characters, and react to the events, I come up with my own opinion of the book. My friend, who is also reading the same book, could form a completely different opinon of the book. But we both gained something by reading the book.      In conclusion, I think that books should be censored by parents and that is it. I think that reading books is a very positive thing. So no one should have the right to tell people what they should and should not read. Also, books are things that can be discussed and everyone can make their own opinions about. It is my opinion that every book should have its own place on a shelf.\"\nEssay Prompt: Censorship in the Libraries.

The author begins by illustrating how books have been integral to individuals from childhood through adulthood, highlighting their role in education and everyday activities. The main argument is that just because one person finds a book offensive does not mean it should be removed from library shelves, as others may benefit from reading it. The author suggests that individuals who find certain books objectionable can simply choose not to read them, reinforcing the idea that diverse opinions are a natural part of human experience. The essay also addresses children's literature, asserting that parents have the responsibility to monitor what their children read, advocating for proactive involvement rather than censorship by libraries. While the essay presents valid points and is generally well-structured, it could benefit from more specific examples to support its claims about the value of diverse literature. The organization is strong, with clear transitions between ideas, and the writing demonstrates good fluency overall. However, there are minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, such as \"apart\" instead of \"a part,\" and \"reciepts\" instead of \"receipts,\" which detract from the professionalism of the writing.

In this essay I'm going to give you my reasoning, and explain , and give some reasons why I think censorship is a good thing , and should maybe be inforced heavier.           Censorship. Should books, music, movies , magazines, etc. be taken off the shelf.. I believe that it is @LOCATION1 , and everyone should have their right to read what they want to,  and what they don't . I believe , that if someone want's to read something vulgur , then let them. If they are an adult , it's their choice. I think as far as the child part of it , that no , children should not be aloud to read things that @MONTH1 be vulgar, sexual , etc.           In keeping children away from these vulgar things , they should have,or keep seperate sections for kids, and adults. I dont think that children should be able to have the access, and maybe they won't know about it, or want it. If their parents think it's okay , and want to let them read it, or watch it, or listen to it,  that before they become an adult they will have to get it for them. I don't believe that children should be candy coated, and blind to the world, I just believe that there is a certain extent to what they need to be limited to.           I obviously think that censorship is a good thing. I think if there was more of it, I think there would be less crime. Kids are learning this , they're watching as young as god knows what, thinking it's okay from the start, and are growing up with that picture ,and message ,of them thinking it's okay  . No I am not saying that all kids learn everything from t.v., etc. ,and yes some @MONTH1 argue that kids dont copy what's on t.v. at all . But I think that t.v. , books, and music affect alot of how children view the world.           As much as I love rap music , and movies such as A.T.L ,rappers such as @ORGANIZATION1, even sometimes when I watch, or listen to those things, it kind of makes me feel like being jaded, and kind of makes me feel like I want to have a bad attitude towards the world, it makes me feel like I wanna live that hard life like that. I think that music , books, what we watch on t.v. , and what we read in the magazines , have a big affect. Such as if we watch the news and there's something depressing, it kind of makes you in a bad mood , or sad or depressed.           The media ,music , t.v., books , magazines, etc., affect our mood, our actions, and even sometimes the way we talk, and dress. I am not saying that dressing that more urban feel is a bad thing , I am just saying when you start doing crime, and drugs because of it, it's a problem. I believe that children should only be censored and not adults, because at the point when u reach adult-hood , your pretty much set in your way's, and have a pretty good look out on what you should be doing, and how you want thing's done. Children are still machuring ,and are like a sponge. Censorship , is a very sensitive , and argumentable/debatable issue, but this is just my view, whats yours ?\"\nEssay Prompt: Censorship in the Libraries.

People do still read or listen to it. And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves. I believe that anything offfensive should'nt be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves.     I listen to music all the time as long a I like the way it sounds. It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and im pretty sure that goes for alot of people. But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying.     I don't really read alot because im picky about the books that I do read. That's not the case for everyone though. Alot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world. It's an escape for them from everyday life. Which I can understand why someone would want to escape.     Movies are like books but you get a visual of whats going on. Which makes it more entertaining than a book. So more people would rather watch a movie. But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling. And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is.     So my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things. But just because someone doesn't like something doesnt mean that someone else wont like it. Like i said everyone is different. So why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well?\nEssay Prompt: Censorship in the Libraries.

Do people have the right to limit imagination? Do people have the right to limit self expression? Many people in today's world think so. Book  censorship is a big deal in the world today. Weather books deemed 'offensive' should be taken out of libraries or not is a serious issue. Censoring books not only limits self expression but it also limits knowledge and our constitutional right of free speech.     I believe people should not be able to censor books. Censoring a book is like putting a limit on human imagination. All through life people are urged to think outside of the box. We are told as kids that being unique and diffrent is a good thing. We are all told this and yet when writers express themselfs in books, the same people that told them to think outside of the box, want to censor their thoughts. By censoring books, we are telling the world that imagination is a bad thing.     Many people want to censor books so their children can not read 'offensive' matterial. They feel that by taking books they feel to be 'offensive' out of libraries, they can sheild their child from the bad things in the world. This is not the case. People @MONTH1 be able to censor books, but no one can censor life. Children will learn 'offensive' things with or without  books.      Book censorship limits knowledge. At the time it was written, The @CAPS1's of @PERSON1, was a very scandels book. Because of the laungauge this book used, many people thought it was trash. Many people wanted it to be censored. Today The @CAPS1's of @ORGANIZATION1 is a famous and classic book. In fact, I was required to read it for school. Regardless of the language this book used, it shows a part of @CAPS3 history. And to think, if people back then would have removed it form the libraries, I most likely would never have read this book, and I would never have the knowledge I gained from reading this book.     It is our constitutional right to write and read the books we choose. America was built on the idea of freedom. Under the constitution we are garentied freedom of speech. By taking books out of libraries, we are limiting our freedom of speech. No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't read a book you want to read. No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't write a book as you want to write it. If we start censoring books, writers will be forced to censor their personal thoughts. Making writers do that, limits thier freedom of speech. If freedom of speech is limited, what other freedoms will also be limited with the years to come?     Book censorship and censorship in gernal, is not a good thing; all it does is limit things. If we start censoring books, we are giving a messege to our children, that diffrent is bad. If freedom of speech is limited, how long will it be untill our other rights are limited? Where will it end?

The author references Katherine Paterson's viewpoint, emphasizing that if everyone removed the books they disliked, there would ultimately be no books left. While the essay raises valid points about the importance of access to varied literature for personal growth and understanding societal issues, it suffers from several critical weaknesses. The content lacks depth and specificity; for instance, the mention of a book that glorifies racism is vague and could benefit from concrete examples to illustrate its potential for provoking critical thought. The organization is weak, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes it difficult for readers to follow the argument's progression. Word choice is often imprecise and informal, undermining the seriousness of the argument; phrases such as \"the libraries fault\" and \"gloryfiying\" detract from clarity. Additionally, sentence fluency is inconsistent, with awkward constructions and overly long sentences affecting readability. There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the essay that further distract from its professionalism. To improve this piece, the author should focus on developing each point with specific examples and clearer explanations while organizing thoughts into distinct paragraphs with clear topic sentences. Refining word choice for precision and correcting grammatical errors will significantly enhance the overall quality of writing.

There's many sections in a library, from fiction to children stories. If there is an area for 'children books,' and 'adult books,' @CAPS1 can't there be one for materials some readers would find offensive? Libraries could even mark a book if it held something offensive.This would settle many conflicts! If a reader chooses to read a book that was marked with offensive content, they would have no right to get upset.       Limiting our libraries shelves is unthinkable.

Never thought I'd see the day. But, that doesn't necessarily mean I approve or agree. Just because I don't approve or agree doesn't mean I do not oppose it. I find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair. Shall we?      Among others, I find that if you censor one thing, you censor them all. Public items such as televisions, radios, magazines, and even books have wriggled their way into our not so perfect world. Yes, there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this. But, is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood? Maybe. Then again, maybe not.      It is true that children, at their youngest, are easily molded and cut out into who they will permenantly be, or at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions on certain topics.For instance, when I was younger, my cousin, who happens to be just a few years older than me, started to like a certain thing. After spending time with her for an elongated amount of time, I started to 'like' it too. I found myself obsessed with it. Now, before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad, I can assure you, it was nothing other than stacks of @CAPS1 cards. Anyway, it wasn't until later that my mother informed me that it wasn't really my interest. It was hers. I modeled after her likes and dislikes. Every other child in the world has done something similar. What makes anybody think they wouldn't do the exact same after listening to uncensored music, watching uncensored television, or reading an uncensored book or magazine?      On the other hand, it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent. If that were the case, nearly every book would be out of sight, but not out of mind. Today, you can't turn on the radio without hearing something about sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking. Now, those things are a lot more accessable to anybody. You can't turn on the computer without advertisements for porn or other sexually crude websites popping up on your screen. Books have gotten out of hand, as well.      The world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place. But in the end, I'm sticking to my original opinion: If you censor one thing, censor them all. It's only fair. Radios, television, movies, and even @CAPS2's have been censored. Books are not as innocent as they seem, anymore. So yes, my final opinion is that libraries should, in fact, censor their books, or at least make an effort to. Libraries are places to learn and have fun doing so, not have a mental scar leading back to what they read in a 'harmless' little book.\"\nEssay Prompt: Censorship in the Libraries.

The author believes that differing opinions on what is considered offensive should not lead to the removal of materials from library shelves, as people have varied tastes and interests. The essay emphasizes that if someone dislikes a book or magazine, they should simply choose not to read it instead of pushing for its removal. While the author presents a valid perspective on the importance of diverse viewpoints, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. The content lacks depth and specificity; while the author asserts that people need to consider others' perspectives, the argument could be strengthened with more concrete examples or data to illustrate the consequences of censorship. The organization is weak, with ideas presented in a somewhat disjointed manner that makes it difficult for readers to follow the main argument. Additionally, word choice is often imprecise and informal, with multiple spelling and grammatical errors, such as \"maganzines\" instead of \"magazines\" and \"dosn't\" instead of \"doesn't,\" which detract from the professionalism of the writing. Sentence fluency is inconsistent, with many run-on sentences that lead to confusion about the author's main points. To improve this essay, the author should focus on structuring their argument more clearly, providing specific examples to support their claims, and refining their language for better clarity and impact.

A piece of music, movie or magazine? Did you ever stop to think that the piece of information that your child was bringing home could be offensive to someone else?     There are points in time where there isn't an answer to that question and you dont want to chose yes or no. The driving question is do you want to remove books, music, movies and magazines from the shelf, just because a parent thinks that its not fit for a child to be reading. Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shel. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that I work abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 point in this quotation is that if you take a book off the shelf everytime that someone doesnt think that its right for children to see, then there will be no books left to see.      In agreement to Katherine, parents @MONTH1 want the best for their children, but there are reasons to why you should agree with the average parent and then there are reasons to why you shouldn't. There are books out amongst the world that only adults should see, and their are also books out there that are way too advance to be read by children. These books are all made for a reason and have there own purpose on why they are put there. Parents have to sit back and think of their children and then think of the rest of the world, its a big world and you cant just take things away from it. No matter how much you want to protect a child from the point of seeing the books that are meant for older age ranges, there isnt a way that you can stop it.      I think that books are there for whatever reason they were written for. There is no reason that because one person doesn't agree with the way that someone has written that book, it should be taken off the shelf just for that child. Libraries cant just start taking books off the shelf for individual mothers that dont like this or dont like that. Many people come from many different areas and see things in a different perspective, they dont know the difference between right and wrong.      It's a bigger world out there than you and me.

It opens with a thought-provoking question aimed at parents, encouraging them to consider the implications of potentially offensive materials on their children. The quote from Katherine Paterson effectively underscores the argument against censorship by highlighting the slippery slope that could lead to the removal of all books deemed inappropriate by someone. However, while the essay presents valid points, it suffers from several weaknesses in organization and clarity. The ideas are somewhat scattered, making it challenging for readers to follow the central argument cohesively. There are instances of vague phrasing and repetition that dilute the impact of the writing, such as the overuse of \"@MONTH1,\" which disrupts the flow and distracts from the message. Word choice is often imprecise; phrases like \"the point in this quotation\" could be articulated more directly to enhance clarity. Additionally, sentence fluency is inconsistent, with some sentences being overly long or convoluted, which affects readability. The essay also contains grammatical errors and awkward constructions that detract from its overall professionalism. To strengthen this piece, it would be beneficial to improve organization by clearly delineating main points and supporting arguments in separate paragraphs. Incorporating specific examples or anecdotes could enrich the argument and provide a more engaging narrative. Lastly, refining word choice for clarity and impact will elevate the overall quality of the writing.

However, the overall effectiveness is limited due to several significant issues. The content lacks depth and nuance; expanding on the importance of diverse perspectives in literature and how libraries serve different communities would strengthen your argument. The organization is weak, with a lack of clear structure or transitions between ideas, making it difficult for readers to follow your thoughts. Word choice is often informal and imprecise, with several spelling errors (e.g., \"librarys,\" \"dosn\u2019t\") and grammatical mistakes that undermine credibility; more careful proofreading and a focus on precise vocabulary would enhance clarity. Sentence fluency is hindered by repetitive sentence structures, which can make the writing feel monotonous; varying your sentence lengths and structures would improve engagement. Additionally, adherence to conventions is poor, with numerous grammatical errors that need correction for professionalism. Overall, while the essay touches on an interesting topic, it requires substantial improvement in content depth, organization, word choice, sentence fluency, and grammatical accuracy to effectively convey your message."}]}

When we remove a book from a library shelve for whatever reason we have to do so then others should have the same right to do so as they see fit. If  picked up a book on why @CAPS3 is the right religion and i am a @CAPS4 then more then likely i will find it offensive. Yet if i gave that same book to a @CAPS3, that person would mostly likely read that exact same book that the @CAPS4 read and find it not offensive at all.

The same issue can be applied to music, movies, magnazines and ect. No matter what we do, some one will be offended. For example, the plege of allegiance is something my school says everyday, yet some people, like a @ORGANIZATION1, find it offensive. All acrosss the nation people say it before school, a sportinh game, or ect., yet you don't see very many people objecting to that. I have obsereved that most people who find it offensive just ignore it so why can't we do the same for books, movies, magazines, and etc. that we @MONTH1 find offensive.     In conclusion, there really is no way to put a cencorship in libraries since no matter to tell what a person might or will find offensive.

The author suggests that if one person can remove a book from the shelves, then others should have the same right, highlighting the subjective nature of offense. However, the essay struggles with several critical weaknesses. The content is somewhat repetitive and lacks depth; while it makes a valid point about varying perspectives, it could benefit from more specific examples to illustrate how censorship impacts society. The organization is also weak, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes it challenging for readers to follow the argument's progression. Additionally, word choice is often imprecise and informal, which detracts from the overall seriousness of the argument; phrases like \"the libraries fault\" and \"the beauty in impurity\" are unclear and could be articulated more effectively. Sentence fluency is inconsistent, with awkward constructions and overly long sentences affecting readability. Furthermore, there are numerous grammatical errors throughout the essay that distract from its professionalism. To improve this piece, the author should focus on developing each point with specific examples and clearer explanations while organizing thoughts into distinct paragraphs with clear topic sentences.

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'.  Although I understand her message, I don't completely agree with it.   I believe most things such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be censored in some cases.       One reason why I think there should be censorship is because of minors that @MONTH1 want to see things that @MONTH1 not be suitable for them.  First of all, children often follow after what they see.  For example, adutly trends that they see on the television. Not all things adults do are not appropriate for the young eyes.That's why I consider that the things that are broadcast should be censored. Children are being influenced by things that they see, read and/or listen to.     Another reason why I believe there should be censorship is because of a lot of very explicit action that appears in today's movies, books, magazines, and music.  Violence is a main topic  in newspaper articles.  For instance, most front page content is about the wars and hostility in the world.  It is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence. Disrespectful acts, cussing, and rude gestures are not a positive way to keep a more mature role going that will make a better environment.  Because libraries are public, they are open to all eyes so we must be careful about what we allow on their shelves.     In addition, censoring is the correct thing to do.  Where would it lead us if we don't? Do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity, violent slogans, or jargon?  Shouldn't we all want to be treated with respect and common courtesy and avoid promoting outrageous movies, music, and books on the shelves of our public libraries for everyone to see.     So now you can see why I believe that such things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should have some type of censorship.  We don't want all the disrespect in the country, so why make it available in our public libraries?  Keep these things separate: adult books, magazine, movies, music, etc.\"\nEssay Prompt: Censorship in the Libraries.

To each person that finds the material offensive, there are always ten people who do not find it offensive at all. A person's beliefs can cloud their views on things like religion. There are so many wrong things out in the world that you can never do right by.      In places like libraries, you never know who might come in to check something out. That is why it is recommended to make sections in the library. Adult novels, childrens book, science finction novels all in different sections of the library. This would make a parent cautious of where their child goes. If a child walks into the wrong sections, there is only one person to blame; the parent. Children always wander off into random places because of curiousity. Parents have to make sure that nothing horrific happens such seeing something that a  toddler or a teenager is not supposed to see.      One object, such as a book, a movie, or a magazine, can teach a person millions of lessons. If those lesson are not tought yet, they will be tought later. In a harder way.

There is always someone that has a different opinion of things. The world contains of many things that people find offensive, but it does not mean those things have to go.

The author contends that if everyone has the right to remove offensive material, it could lead to a situation where there are no books left for anyone. The essay emphasizes that while some individuals may find certain content offensive, there are many others who do not share the same views, suggesting that personal beliefs can skew perceptions of appropriateness. The author advocates for designated sections in libraries to help parents monitor what their children access, arguing that children\u2019s curiosity can lead them to explore inappropriate materials. Furthermore, the essay posits that exposure to various materials can teach valuable life lessons, even if those lessons are difficult. The author concludes by asserting that removing materials from libraries could lead to societal issues, including conflict and misunderstanding.\r\nWhile the essay presents a clear viewpoint, it contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, such as \"adutly trends\" instead of \"adult trends\" and \"tought\" instead of \"taught,\" which detract from its overall clarity and professionalism. Additionally, the organization could be improved; while the ideas are relevant, they could be structured more cohesively to enhance flow and coherence. For instance, transitioning between points about parental responsibility and the value of diverse materials could be smoother. To improve this essay, the author should focus on refining language and grammar while ensuring a logical progression of ideas throughout the argument. By addressing these areas for improvement, the essay can more effectively communicate its stance on censorship in libraries and engage readers with a well-supported argument."}]}

Some people think we should take books off the shelf that teach the kid's our history. People don't have that right to take away from children. In the statement Katherine made, she is supporting that very idea; taking away our kids right to learn US history. The kids have that right to learn our very own history and some people want to take that away. Then what will our future generation be like. Some kid's might not even know who @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is or how we got here to this very continent.     Parents also don't want us to read anything in books that have foul language or anything to do with nudity. I see what theese parents are trying to do. They are trying to protect their children, but the fact is people are going to have to go through this in life and if they arn't introduced at a younger age what will they do when they are older. Some kids that have that right taken away from will have no idea what to do when they get older and the foul language in the texts of theese books put voice into the books. We don't want the up coming generations to be blind to all of this because it is the real world.     When I was was in fifth grade I liked to read alot. I really liked the adventure books such a the boxcar children and books like that. One time I went into the library and I picked out a book about a haunted house. The librarian would not let me check the book out because there were some texts in the book not apropriate for me. That sort of crushed my reading spirit and I really never wanted to go and check out a book by myself any more. So adults that want to take theese books of the shelves you might be stopping our generation from learning and if we don't learn then our next generation isn't going to want to read anything or learn.     Theese are just a couple of reason we should not take books, magazines, movies, and music away from us. There are more people out there that have reasons to, so if you want to take this right away from us then be prepared for an argument because will fight for this right.

A few reason explain why the censorship is alright as it is.  Those reason are That the parents should be in charge of the books their children read, that not all people agree on censorship, and that the libraries have books of different subjects that people like to read.     The first reason is that parents shoud be in charge of what their children read.  If the parents would just tell their children no to a certain book, then the child will not read it.  If the parent does not want their child to go into a section then, the parents can just say keep away from that area.  Although, sometimes the child @MONTH1 stray away from its parents it is not very likely that the parent will not notice.  That is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read.     The second reason is that not all people agree on censorship.  Certain people think that religion is important no matter what the book shows, but others would think parts of religious book (nudity, swears, etc...) is extremely innapropriate.  Some people would say that books like @CAPS1 mythology books are innapropriate and need to be censored, although others think these books are past culture and that they should remain in the libraries forever.  Most children will look at these books and think that the books are to big to read, so they would not even look at them.  Few people would agree on censorships, and a lot of people would disagree.     The third reason is that libraries have different subjects than the innapropriate books.  The people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others.  It is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say '@CAPS2 I want to read that one.' the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort.  The point being that a person can read other books than just innapropriate books.     Library books should be kept the same because the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have different subjects that people want to read. The censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree.

The author begins with a rhetorical question about living in a free country, suggesting that while there are many things people might find offensive, they still seek out this information through various media sources. The argument raises valid points about the subjective nature of offense, particularly regarding sensitive topics like racism and violence in the news. However, the essay suffers from significant weaknesses in clarity and organization. The writing is often disjointed, making it difficult for readers to follow the main argument. There are numerous grammatical errors, such as \"its a free country\" instead of \"it's a free country,\" and awkward phrasing that detracts from the overall professionalism of the piece. Additionally, sentence fluency is inconsistent, with run-on sentences that lead to confusion about the author's main points. To improve this essay, the author should focus on structuring their argument more clearly, providing specific examples to support their claims, and refining their language for better clarity and impact. By addressing these areas for improvement, the essay can more effectively communicate its message about the complexities of censorship and the importance of individual choice in media consumption."}]}

If my child was in elementry or even middle school , I wouldn't at all want them to be able to check out a book about things they shouldn't even know about yet.

They also could be doing a project over the wrongs of pornagraphy, in which the library is better place to find a book then the interent that could take them to many bad websites. Since I go to my local high school I think its nice to be able to find anything I need in my library at school. It makes it easier to work on projects.      Also in libraries there are a ton of music, movies, and magazines. If a library has educational music, why not keep them in there? If the music is rap, pop, or country they could just get it from @CAPS1 instead of the library providing it. Magazines can also be educational. If you are doing a project on fashion a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 would be excellent to help them find out some tips. Magazines can also have some inaproprate things in them. Since all they talk about in the media is sex, sex articles would probably be in the magazines. Whenever I look in magazines I just skip all of that nonsense they talk about and read the articles about clothes, food, and people. Exposing that to young children wouldn't be the best, but for teenagers they understand. Movies shouldn't be in the library unless they are educational too. There are a ton of @CAPS4 around that those scary movies don't need to be in a library.     In conclusion I think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library. For young children, stay with the cartoon educational type things. For teenagers, keep it educational but be more relaxed about it.

The author expresses the belief that young adults should have the freedom to read any book or article they choose, emphasizing that even if a book is considered controversial, it may still provide valuable educational benefits to some readers. The argument highlights the subjective nature of what is considered offensive, noting that while some individuals may find certain content graphic or distressing, others may be able to handle it. However, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. The content lacks depth and specificity; while the author mentions examples like \"The Hunger Games\" series and a book written by a person in incarceration, these references could be elaborated upon to strengthen the argument. The organization is somewhat disjointed, making it difficult for readers to follow the progression of ideas. Additionally, there are numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, such as \"band\" instead of \"banned,\" \"impotant\" instead of \"important,\" and \"atainable\" instead of \"attainable,\" which detract from the professionalism of the writing. Sentence fluency is inconsistent, with several run-on sentences that affect readability. To improve this essay, the author should focus on providing clearer examples and evidence to support their claims while enhancing overall coherence and clarity. By refining word choice and correcting grammatical errors, the essay can more effectively communicate its message about the importance of preserving access to diverse materials in libraries while advocating for individual choice in reading."}]}

Well, if items are banned from being seen or read then there will be no creativity in the @CAPS1, there will soon be no books or magazines to read, no music to listen too, and no movies to watch, and you will not be able to express yourself or your opinions. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     If the @CAPS1 is left without certain materials there will be no creativity. Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are protrayed to be offensive. No one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned, this will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently.     In the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive, all books will eventually be eliminated. Certain topics aren't liked by everyone and, as Katherine Paterson says, '...if I have the right to remove that book... so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson is exactly right too; if one person has the right to remove a book, so does everyone and this will cause everyone to take off that book that they dislike so much. Also, everyone likes different kinds of books and different topics, and this will cause less self expression because if someone doesn't like books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because they think it is offensive to @CAPS4, then there will be no books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on the shelves for anyone to learn about it.     Everyone will turn out to be the same if they can't express themselves or their opinions. If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned. If you can't read or watch a topic you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone. Also, if people can pick what books can be in a library, that will eventually be transferred over into other areas, such as clothing, food, thoughts, etc..

The problem with the @ORGANIZATION1 is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people.  The truth is that when you have as many as there is in a country, there are going to be many different ideas, thoughts, likes, and dislikes.     Libraries are places of knowledgee.  They keep many differnt books, magazines, and movies there, so that people with all different tastes can enjoy the library.  Most people, with books, figure out early what genre of books, which authors, and how long of books they like.  So books are usually very hard to offend people, because most people can usually tell right away if they like the book or not.     Magazines are like books in away.  People know what they want.  With magazines though, people ususally just flip threw the pages, and skim through articles. They will keep skiming through the magazine, until they find that perfect article they want to read.  Usually after that, they are done with the magazine.     Music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around.  There is something about music that soothes the human body.  Music is one of those things that ais constantly changing with time.  Before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced.  Now it would be nice if there was just one type of music that everybody liked, but there isn't.  There are so many types of genres of music, that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music.     There are people who hate change. Likewise thet don't like to change there favorite music types.  But if people changed with time, then there would really only be a  few types of music.  But since there are many types of music, there is always going to be someone out there in the world that doesn't think that song shouldn't be played.     Just in the last century movies have came along way in advancement.  Movies use to be simple, they would have a simple plot, and everyone loved it.  But there are so many people who love to see technology advance, that they want movies to change.  Movies today are all about special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, fighting, and the list could go on and on.  Directores try to make the best movie possible, so its almost like they try to put just enough of one thing to keep the audience into the movie.  But if they go overboard on a subject, that is when at least one person has a red flag go up in their head and think that is offensive.     Movies are suppose to be enteraaning, not something people should get offended by.  Movies are good about it though.  They have created a rating system to try give the audience a fair warning heads up, so that the audience knows what to suspect in the movie.     It doesn't matter what it is, book, magazine, music or movie, there is always going to be someone who doesn't like it or is just offended by it.  There is nothing to do about that, and it's not a bad thing.  It's just simply means everyone in this world is not the same.

The content introduces relevant points about parental responsibility and the need for libraries to offer a variety of materials; however, the argument lacks depth and specific examples to support these claims. The organization is weak, with ideas presented in a somewhat disjointed manner, making it difficult for readers to follow your reasoning clearly. Word choice is often imprecise, with several spelling errors (e.g., \"cenorship,\" \"childern,\" \"inappopreite\") that detract from the professionalism of the essay. Sentence fluency is hindered by awkward phrasing and repetitive structures, which can disengage readers. Additionally, adherence to conventions is poor, with frequent grammatical mistakes that need correction for clarity and readability. Overall, while the essay raises important issues regarding censorship and its implications for children, it requires significant improvement in content depth, organization, word choice, sentence fluency, and grammatical accuracy to effectively convey its message."}]}

As the cyclist continues toward his destination, he encounters both straight roads and steep hills, which add to his physical struggle. The mention of nearly running into a snake introduces an element of danger, further illustrating the perils of his journey. Overall, the essay successfully highlights how the setting impacts the cyclist's experience, emphasizing themes of perseverance and survival in extreme conditions. However, while the content is strong, the writing could benefit from improved sentence structure and varied vocabulary to enhance clarity and engagement. By refining these aspects, the essay can more effectively communicate the profound effects of the desert environment on the cyclist's journey."}]}

The writer captures the shift in the cyclist's emotional state, from optimism at the start of the journey to distress as the lack of water and the challenging terrain take their toll. The essay effectively describes key moments where the setting influences the cyclist's experience, such as the struggle with the rusted water pump, the sight of an abandoned building, and the eventual relief at finding Gary and Wilber's Fish Camp. However, there are some issues with language clarity, especially in phrases like \"dehightrated state\" (which should be \"dehydrated\") and \"he thought he knew where he was going\" (which switches between \"she\" and \"he\"). These errors slightly hinder the overall readability. Nevertheless, the essay's narrative structure is strong, and the connection between the cyclist's changing emotions and the environment is well-explored. More attention to language mechanics would improve the clarity, but the essay does a solid job of addressing the prompt with appropriate detail and coherence."}]}

The author notes that the scorching desert and sparse plant life create a sense of isolation that induces fear and anxiety about water and heatstroke, contrasting this with a hypothetical scenario in a rainforest where such worries would be absent. The essay suggests that the cyclist's mindset is influenced by his surroundings; if he had visualized a more favorable environment, he might have felt less stressed. The mention of obstacles like tumbleweeds and a large snake highlights the physical dangers he faces, but the author argues that focusing more on the task at hand rather than his fears could have led to greater success. While the essay presents interesting ideas about mental preparation and visualization, it suffers from grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as \"siked himself out\" instead of \"psyching himself out.\" To improve, the author should refine language for clarity, enhance organization for better flow, and provide more detailed analysis of how mental preparation could mitigate the cyclist's struggles in such a challenging environment.

For example, how does the lack of water affect the cyclist\u2019s determination or drive? The description of the cyclist\u2019s feelings of loneliness and fear, especially when seeing \"no one in sight,\" adds depth, but the essay could further analyze how these emotions impact his behavior or decision-making.

However, the essay lacks depth and detail; while it identifies key challenges, it does not elaborate on how these experiences affect the cyclist emotionally or physically. Additionally, the organization is somewhat simplistic, with ideas presented in a list-like manner rather than developing a cohesive narrative. The language used is straightforward but could benefit from more vivid descriptions and varied sentence structures to enhance engagement. To improve this essay, the author should focus on expanding each point with specific examples and emotional insights, creating a more compelling narrative that captures the cyclist's struggles and triumphs in greater detail. By enhancing the depth of analysis and refining the writing style, the essay can more effectively convey the impact of the setting on the cyclist's journey."}]}

The sentence structure is also repetitive, and there is little variety in the way the ideas are expressed. The essay lacks a clear, cohesive narrative that ties together the cyclist\u2019s experience and how the setting affects them. A more detailed and reflective exploration of the setting\u2019s impact would strengthen the argument and make the analysis more engaging."}]}

The connection between the plant surviving the harsh conditions and Saeng\u2019s ability to endure challenges in a new country is insightful and relevant. The essay correctly identifies how the plant symbolizes Saeng\u2019s growth and adaptation to her new environment, but it would benefit from further exploration of the plant\u2019s deeper symbolic meaning and its relationship to Saeng\u2019s emotional journey.

However, the argument lacks depth and clarity, especially in relation to the symbolic meaning of the hibiscus plant. The idea that the hibiscus represents Saeng\u2019s connection to her homeland and provides her with confidence is a reasonable interpretation, but the essay does not fully explain how the plant contributes to her determination. The statement about the hibiscus being \"a reminder of home\" feels somewhat underdeveloped, as the hibiscus in the story is not just a nostalgic symbol but also one of rebirth and resilience, which could have been emphasized more strongly. Moreover, the claim that Saeng \"needs something to help her\" is an interesting point, but the essay doesn\u2019t explore why the hibiscus specifically is chosen as that source of support. The analysis could be further enriched by discussing how the plant\u2019s symbolism connects to the larger themes of the story, such as overcoming adversity and finding strength in the face of challenges. Additionally, the essay's language quality detracts from the overall coherence, especially in sentences like \"she ll ve mast to pass,\" which is unclear. More careful editing and a deeper connection to the symbolism in the text would improve this response significantly."}]}

The comparison of winter to death and spring to rebirth effectively ties the seasons to Saeng's emotional journey. The essay accurately identifies how the melting of snow mirrors the melting of Saeng's fears, symbolizing her readiness for a new phase in her life. This interpretation is well-aligned with the theme of overcoming past struggles and embracing change. The essay\u2019s argument about Saeng's transformation through the seasons is insightful, though it would be more impactful if it provided additional evidence from the text to support these ideas. For example, expanding on the significance of the \"snow geese\" and their return in spring would provide a more concrete connection to the theme of renewal. Additionally, while the essay briefly mentions the change in Saeng\u2019s heart, it could benefit from more detailed exploration of her emotional growth.

The essay correctly notes that Saeng\u2019s relationship with the changing seasons mirrors her personal development and adaptation to her new environment. However, the explanation is underdeveloped, and the points made are vague. For example, the connection between the hibiscus blooming and Saeng\u2019s adaptation to her new society is only briefly mentioned and could benefit from further elaboration. The idea of Saeng's eventual success being tied to the blooming hibiscus is valid but needs more exploration to tie it back to her emotional journey and the specific struggles she faces. The mention of spring as a time of renewal is a relevant point but would be more compelling if connected to Saeng\u2019s personal growth and emotional transformation. The essay could also explore more deeply the relationship between Saeng's homesickness and her eventual acceptance of her new life. To strengthen this analysis, the essay could provide more examples from the text that showcase how Saeng\u2019s transformation parallels the changes in nature. Overall, while the essay has potential, it lacks sufficient detail and clarity to fully analyze the conclusion."}]}

The essay does not delve into Saeng\u2019s emotional journey or the symbolic role of the plant in her growth.

The essay successfully explains that Saeng finds motivation in her surroundings, particularly the hibiscus, which symbolizes resilience and a new beginning. The greenhouse imagery also reflects her emotional journey, linking the plants to Saeng's nostalgia and adaptation to a new life. While the analysis captures the thematic connection between Saeng's environment and her growth, further elaboration on how the hibiscus specifically ties to the concept of \"rebirth\" or renewal would strengthen the argument.

However, the analysis could be improved by expanding on the connection between the hibiscus plant and Saeng\u2019s internal transformation.

I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, \"\"My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air...\"\". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, \"\"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"\"family\"\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\"\" And where it also says, \"\"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship.\"\"At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having \"\"Such courage\"\" and how \"\"They came selflessly\"\" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, \"\"I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice.\"\" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood.

The essay fails to adhere to the prompt, as it does not fully explore the themes of gratitude and family, and it struggles to connect ideas meaningfully. The language is simplistic, offering little emotional depth, and the narrative lacks engagement. To improve, the essay needs a clearer structure, more precise vocabulary, and deeper exploration of the themes of gratitude and friendship.

Some of the biggest problems that the builders faced were unpredictable and violent winds, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, and air laws. The winds posed to be a problem because even though the front of the dirigible would be tethered to the mast belonged back side would be allowed to swing freely in the wind which could cause it to crash into another moored dirigible. The winds also would make just getting to the Empire a hazardous job. The use of hydrogen was a problem because hydrogen is a volatile gas in the sense that it explodes, which would be very dangerous over a densely populated area. Lastly, the air laws were a problem because the United States has a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would make a mooring at the Empire State Building illegal.\"\nEssay Prompt: Based on the excerpt, describe the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

One huge problem was due to the building's foundation. A swinging blimp, which can be up to a thousand feet in length, on top of the building would add a huge amount of stress. This meant extra money would need to be dumped into the strengthening of the foundation and framework, in order to support a huge zeppelin on the mooring mast. Since the building tops out at 1,250 feet in altitude, fierce air currents rip through the top of the building. This caused impossible docking conditions because the blimp could hit the building and pop. Due to the flammability of hydrogen this dangerous eruption could wreck havoc on the densely populated city below. Refering to the Hindenburg explosion in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 1937, \"\"The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated area.\"\" Due to the mainly safety reasons the Docking station for dirigibles was never built.\"\nEssay Prompt: Based on the excerpt, describe the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

One obstacle was that a dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable, would add stress to the buildings frame. The still frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withstand the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast. Another major obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for the ships to ever tie up or even approached the building. The last obstacles the builders had to get around was the issue with safety. Most dirigibles used either helium or hydrogen, both highly flammable gases.

While the content is relevant and demonstrates an understanding of patience, it lacks depth and could be more insightful, especially in terms of connecting personal experiences to broader lessons. The organization needs improvement, as the ideas feel somewhat disjointed, and transitions between sections are abrupt. The word choice is functional but lacks specificity, particularly when describing the patience required in different scenarios. Sentence fluency is weak, with awkward phrasing and grammatical issues that disrupt the flow. While conventions are mostly followed, there are several errors in grammar and punctuation, which detract from the essay\u2019s professionalism. The essay does attempt to adhere to the prompt, but it doesn't fully explore the nuances of patience or offer meaningful reflections. The language used is clear but could be more expressive to better engage the reader. The narrative, while valid, lacks strong storytelling elements, and the essay would benefit from more vivid descriptions or emotional depth.

The content is interesting and offers personal insight, though it lacks depth and could benefit from more context or elaboration on the emotional aspects of the experience. The organization is generally clear, but the transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, which makes it harder for the reader to follow the flow. Word choice is functional, but there are moments where greater precision in language could enhance the clarity of the story. Sentence fluency is hindered by repetitive phrasing and inconsistent sentence structure, which affects readability. Conventions are somewhat adhered to, but there are frequent errors, particularly in punctuation, that detract from the overall professionalism of the writing.

The content is sparse and lacks any substantial exploration of the concept, with vague references to waiting in serious situations like the army. This results in a shallow treatment of the topic that does not effectively communicate the importance or challenges of patience. The organization is weak, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes it hard to follow. The essay\u2019s language is informal but lacks expressiveness, failing to engage the reader or convey the intended message effectively. There are significant issues with conventions, including grammatical errors and improper sentence structure. To improve, the essay would benefit from a more structured argument and clearer examples that better illustrate the theme of patience.

At times like this I use my gift, the gift of laughter. My best friend, @PERSON1 looked at me with her big blue eyes, they were swelled up with tears. We had just finished packing the rest of her clothes and we knew it was time to say goodbye. It hurt me deeply to see her go after five years of friendship but, we had postponed this moment long enough. There the boxes sat waiting, each with their own label, they had all of our memories inside. We were never very serious, we liked to joke a lot and she always knew how to make me smile, today that would be hard though. After we put @PERSON1's stuff in the moving van I noticed her dog, @PERSON2 wasn't outside like he normally is. When I went inside I found out he hadn't been hiding in there either. This was strange because @PERSON2 was the type of dog that liked to have a lot of attention so he was always near you. When I told @PERSON1 that @PERSON2 was missing, we went to look for him.    It was @DATE1 time, my favorite time of year and the sun felt warm against my skin. I remember this moment very clearly, it was a memory I was sure I would want to savor. As we walked along @PERSON1 and I talked about all sorts of things, this made me almost forget she was going to have to leave in a few hours. Just then I noticed a shinny silver object laying in the ground, from where I was standing I couldn't quite read what the engrave stated but I could see the one letter that said it all, the letter @CAPS1. It was @PERSON2's red and blue collar, I reached down and picked it up I figured he must be somewhere near. Fate must have been with us that day because as soon as we glanced up the road we saw @PERSON2 riding in the back of someones old @ORGANIZATION1 truck. We started running after that truck as fast as we could and we were screaming, \"\"@CAPS2! Finally the truck stopped in front of our local store, the guy stepped out and he seemed aggravated with us.\"\"That's my dog.\"\" @PERSON1 stated, and I just shook my head in agreement. The strange man looked at us in wonderment and then looked at @LOCATION1. His face turned red in embarrassment as he too realized the dog in the back did not belong to him. This whole situation was funny and all we could do was laugh. With @PERSON2 beside us we started walking home, taking our time, dreading what would take place when we arrived back at @LOCATION2's house. That night I stayed up thinking about @PERSON1 and @LOCATION1, I was great full to that dog for running off so we could spend more time together. Also I was thinking that maybe he had a reason for leaving, maybe he knew that we weren't ready to say goodbye and we had to have one last adventure, one last laugh. When we laughed together for the last time that day, I knew that we would truly be friends forever no matter if she lived near or far.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

It was in the middle of @DATE1 and we were sitting outside on top of the wooden table in our mother's backyard. @PERSON2 started telling me how much he wanted to be done with high school and that he was, \"\"just done with all this.\"\" I sat there listening attentively for maybe thirty minutes as @PERSON2 poured his heart out, and nearly broke mine with how distressed he was. @PERSON2's best friend, @PERSON1, had just told @PERSON2 that @CAPS1 he went out with the girl @PERSON2 liked, then their friendship was over. @PERSON2 was extremely hurt by this betrayal added on top of how he was afraid of getting kicked out of school because of his grades, and the amount of pressure coming from our parents at the time, was simply too much for seventeen year old @PERSON2 to handle. I talked to @PERSON2 for at least another half hour after that about what I thought he should do, at the end of our heart to heart talk I told @PERSON2 that, \"\"@CAPS1 you don't get it together and start geting good grades, their going to kick you out of school, @PERSON2. Honestly, @CAPS1 that happens I'm going to be really mad at you; becaus the only person @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are going to have to nag on is me.\"\" We both laughed quietly for a minute, paused, and laughed until we cried.  I don't know to this day what was so funny, maybe how serious everything was when we were just kids or @CAPS1 it was simply a release of stress and anxiety for both of us. My tiny, little, lame joke that I dropped at the end of our talk just made it all seem okay, made us think about how young we are, how minor so many of these problems were in the grand scheme of life. That inital laughter made is possible for us to simply let go. After this happened @PERSON2 and I went on with our lives as @CAPS1 this had never happened, never speaking of it. Except that @PERSON2 never got a bad grade in the rest of his high school career, he chose his friend over a chance at the girl but found another girl who has @ORGANIZATION1's approval.

The content is relevant to the prompt, but it lacks a deeper exploration of how laughter influences those relationships beyond surface-level observations. The anecdote about the writer's relationship with their girlfriend is a good example of how laughter can bridge gaps, but it could benefit from more reflection on the emotions involved. Organization is fairly straightforward, but the ideas jump from one point to another without clear transitions, which affects the overall flow. Word choice is simple and sometimes imprecise, particularly when discussing abstract concepts like happiness and laughter. There are several awkward phrases that detract from clarity, such as \u201cAnger is not something someone wants to deal with all the time; you have to relax every now and then.\u201d Sentence fluency is uneven, with some choppy or repetitive sentences that could be more varied for smoother reading. Conventions are an area of concern, with multiple punctuation errors and inconsistent capitalization, which distract from the professionalism of the essay. While the essay adheres to the prompt, a more thoughtful exploration of laughter\u2019s role in relationships, as well as a clearer, more polished writing style, would strengthen it. Language is simple but could be more expressive to add depth to the emotional narrative. The narrative could be more engaging with richer details and a deeper exploration of the emotional impact of laughter.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Essay: \" My best friend @PERSON2 turned thirteen on a beautiful @DATE1 day. Her family had a boat and, since it the weather was not quite uncomfortably hot but not so cold that it was chilly outside, @PERSON2 decided to have a sleepover birthday party on the deck with some of her closest freinds. I was nervous about meeting her school-going friends since I'd always been a homeschooler and wasn't going to know any of the other people there. When I arrived at the boat, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friends @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. I greeted them all and @PERSON2 suggested we go @CAPS2. I was ready to walk down to the beach but @PERSON4 said she wanted to go @CAPS2 right on the docks. @CAPS2 by the boats wasn't allowed and I was certain @PERSON2 would say @CAPS1 immidiately but instead she walked over to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sign, tore it down, and tossed it in the harbor. Her friends laughed and I laughed too. I'd never seen people act this way. But their disregard for rules and customs was contagious. As the day went by I watched the was they talked and behaved. The girls used bad language and spoke harshly. Everything they said was loud and shocking and everything they did was to be wild and challange authority. They acted so free but there was something about their interactions with each other that seemed forced. I wondered if they were truly this way or if they were just pretending. But I understood that to be part of them I had to act like them. It was my first expirience with peer pressure and I didn't know quite what to do. But the girls' attutudes were simple, so I adapted and started to behave like them. But it became clear to me that in order for there to be a group there has to be someone who wasn't in the group. That was @PERSON3. @PERSON2' parents had made her invite @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 and @PERSON1 knew it. They would sit close together so she didn't quite have room, they would look with disintrest at her without laughing when she tried to make a joke. I became aware that if I hadn't adapeted so quickly to the attitude of the girls, I might have been the one they left out. I also knew that they could still turn on me if I did something wrong. We were sitting on the deck of the boat talking about movies and @PERSON3 was trying to tell the group about one that she'd just seen and was now her favorite. @PERSON1 stared blankly at her, refusing to smile. @PERSON4 looked off into space. @PERSON2 rolled her eyes to me. Sudenly, @PERSON1 cut @PERSON3 off and started talking about a scary movie she'd just seen. @PERSON3's eyes widened, then she looked down at the ground. Without thinking, I laughed and reached out to her arm, telling her I wanted to hear more about the movie. I'll never forget the way she lit up at that simple kindness. She smiled and began to gush about how amazing it was with renewed enthusuasm. @PERSON1 condinuted her story while watching @PERSON3 and me. @TIME1, when we went to the movie theater and the girls chose to sit in a row that only had room for four, I moved to sit with @PERSON3 in the next row down. We talked about the absurdity of straws for drinks and how we would never, ever wear skinny jeans. It was easy to talk to her. I didn't have to run everything I said through my head to make sure it wouldn't make anyone dislike me. Even @TIME1 when we were back at the boat, I tried to behave in the same way. I'd never had to focus on being myself before but I knew if I could do it, @PERSON3 would have someone to talk to. To my surprise, everyone became more natural. Soon we were all joking about what ridiculous things @PERSON2 should wish for with her birthday wish. I suggested a lifetime supply of marshmellows. @PERSON4 suggested the original @CAPS3 of @CAPS4. @PERSON3 suggested to wish that everyone in america would speak with a @CAPS5 accent on @PERSON2' birthday from now on. Everyone laughed. I saw that day that kindness if more powerful than crulty. Making someone an enemy or an outsider doesn't make a friendship stronger. Neither does having to worry about saying or doing something that might make your friends reject you. But integrity and kindness can bring people closer.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Essay: \" Somewhere along the road a guy once said \"\"a laugh a day keeps the doctor away.\"\" @CAPS1 the hell was he talking about? I didn't really know or understand the importance of it either. Until i found out first hand how important those words could be, and how right that unknown genius was. It was just a few years ago when the most traumatic event happened to me.Do you remember that first girl or guy you thought you loved? If you can, do u recall that feeling of heartbreak and utter distraught? Well, if u can then u might understand how I felt...and sometimes do feel. If not you @MONTH1 learn something of importance to which you might realize why you're single. Before that certain event,when @CAPS2 and I would end up fighting, we'd end up making jokes about it to get through. We'd sometimes intentionally go to see romantic movies to laugh at how the girl or guy in them would break down crying. In one of those sobbing weeping, just obnoxious sounding cries. The kind that pisses you off more than making you feel sympathetic. Back to the later and key point of all of this, when the horrible situation occurred @CAPS2 and i were together for years, two and a half to be specific. yeah, long time I know. The day it ended it happened to be in the middle of math class (can you believe that? the middle of freaking class!) @CAPS4 convinced me to go sit back in the corner of the room with her. It'd be just us, no interruptions. We did this everyday so it wasn't anything to unusual to me. I was thinking \"\"yeah! i get to work alone with my amazing girlfriend!\"\" I was such a idiot. I do fondly remember glancing her over before sitting down. @CAPS4 was wearing white bleached jeans and a black band t-shirt. @CAPS4 had skin so white and unblemished a porcelain doll would be jealous. To top it all off dirty blond hair, rose petal lips and believe me on this one unending curves. I was dressed similar. I was in my @PERSON1 t-shirt, black jeans and my signature burgundy beanie. I had natural tan glowing skin and dark brown curly hair that covered my dark green eyes. When I sat down I'm not exactly sure @CAPS1 it was, but I felt like something bad was going to happen. Almost like a oncoming thunder storm or that paranoid feeling of being watched. The most dreadful words fell out of her mouth like water coming out of a faucet. \"\"We have to break up\"\" my heart seized in my chest her other words blurred into one becoming inaudible. I remained not moving and completely silent like a stone gargoyle. I couldn't help, but laugh at myself silently inside my head. I didn't ever say anything back. I didn't trust my voice enough to be steady and unwavering. Even if my words didn't...my body did. I couldn't control the shaking of my body as if it was having one big muscle spasm. I quietly and quickly walked out of the room making sure to have my bag in hand. I didn't want a reason to have to come back. The hallways along with the tiles and eventually grass along with the pouring rain all blurred into one. I just kept on walking and walking, with no wear in mind. Until when i was finally to tired to stop. My cheeks were tear streaked to my jawline and my eyes were red and bloodshot. The most wonderful thing in the world to me in my life had ended. As i look back at @CAPS2 and I's relationship, laughter was how we survived and got through a lot. It was however not enough. No amount of trying to laugh it off would help, like those petty arguments we had. I will sometimes though look back on how I reacted and that by itself will make me laugh. I was no better than those people in those movies. Unlike them however, I did not weep and bawl obnoxiously.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

It can help you solve an argument with a friend, improve your health, and help in akward situations. All relationships need a little laughter to lighten the mood once in awhile. If we didn't have it, everything would be taken seriously all the time, and there would be many more feuds. One instence where laughter has helped, was when my best friend, @PERSON1, and I were in a big fight about someone spilling paint on a pair of shorts she owned. We were both accusing one another, and the more that happened, the worse the fight became overall. I remember right in the middle of the fight, @PERSON1 made a face that for some reason made me laugh. Once I laughed I could tell she wasn't amused. She began questioning why I was laughing. So I explained to her why I had been laughing, and she ran to the bathroom and looking into the mirror, made the same face that I had been laughing over. To my surprise, she started laughing as well. After the ten-minute laughing fit, I made a joke about the paint on her shorts, and we decided to splatter them with paint for a rather \"\"unique\"\" look. Needless to say, laughing saved us from getting into an even bigger argument. When people are angry or upset, physically they probably don't feel that good. They @MONTH1 feel angry for days, which in turn can give them physical pain. I know for me if I'm angry long enough I'll succumb to a headache and ironically, I get more angry at people around me because my head hurts and they're making it worse. Laughing is a way of @CAPS1 things go. Not necessarily being carefree, but learning to let go and live. Physical health is greatly affected by laughter. As well as mental health. Everyone needs to laugh to stay sane. Learning to not sweat the small stuff is really important. My favorite thing to hear is \"\"let go laughing.\"\" @CAPS1 go of a problem while laughing is the best way to get rid of problems. I've also noticed that when you laugh more you feel better overall. You have more energy, but that's usually from the endorphines kicking in when you have a crazy fit of laughter. But also it lightens the mood tons when you're with other people. All people need to laugh. Married couples, students, teachers, and best friends. Laughing can bring people together. In the end, laughing can benefit you in many ways. It can help resolve feuds, lighten moods, and have good effects on your mental and physical health. And the best thing to always remember is to let go laughing.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

Laughter brings people you have known from a long time together because you have had a feeling for that person and for the moment. Laughing at the memories that were spent with that person and enjoying it can make you closer to that person and it can be important to that relationship. In fact, it has happened to me before; laughter came to me when i saw a special video from my past. It was when one of my favorite cousins was two years old and i was three years old at a family party. My cousin was very chubby and with straight hair, but that day she was very sick from fever. I was very different because i had curly hair and was short. We both had a dress on, but the dresses had different styles. Then everyone at the party was having fun and we were, too. The video got to the part when my cousin and i were bouncing up and down grabbing our dress and making a show for everyone at the party. In that time we were suppose to be dancing. It seemed we were having to much fun that day. Afterward, my youngest brother came close to where we were dancing to see us dance, but he was caring with him a cup of soda. Then one of the grown ups gets up from its chair and bumps into him and he drops his cup of soda which splashed my cousin and me. All of our dress were wet, dirty ,and sticky from the soda. We both stopped dancing and sat down on the ground and started to cry. My aunt and my mom changed us to something else, but later when we saw my brother we were so mad that we didn't answer him when he asked us something or wanted to talk to us for that fact. Later on, we were having fun again and talked to him back again. Finally, the video stopped. It's important that laughter gets people closer to someone because together they're having a great moment while laughing. My cousin and i watching the video remembering our memories made us laugh from what happened to both of us. We have shared the same feelings and the innocent we were at that age. We noticed how much we had changed right now from all the funny times we had enjoyed together. We did realize that it was not my brothers fault for splashing us with soda. Laughing from all the moments we shared helped my cousin and me to be more united. Obviously, in different time in life you react in a different way, but laughing in that moment or later on gets people together. Sometimes in time feelings are different, but laughing is important because you're sharing the moment of happiness with someone. I remember events from my past with my family and we get closer to each other and have some laughter for the happy moments.  \"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

I don't know if this is true but I can believe it. When I laugh I feel lighter, my stress load lightens, @PERSON1 I am able to see the world with different eyes. This change in myself is more evident sometimes than others, such as if before the miracle of laughter I was feeling overworked, worn out, or sad. It is my belief that having people to make you laugh is essential to living a fulfilling life, @PERSON1 I am grateful that my days are filled with great friends @PERSON1 funny memories.  One of the things that must be present in any relationship is humor; you must be able to make each other laugh. I have had multiple times with my two best friends, @PERSON1, when we simply couldn't stop laughing. I deeply cherish all the time we spend alone together because I know that I will leave feeling happy, with a smile on my face, with many good stories to tell. One of these occasions was @PERSON1's birthday party the @DATE1 before last.  @PERSON1 wanted a small party with just the people closest to her there, so @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I were the only ones invited. We live a tiny, cute town, however, there isn't much to do in the area of parties. Because of this, everyone ends up going to @CAPS1, just half an hour away. It was a blistering @DATE1 day @PERSON1 we wanted to show off our tans, so of course @PERSON1 started her party off with a float on the meandering @CAPS2 river. That's when the laughing began. Three twelve year old girls drifting down a river by themselves with a giant beach ball (early birthday present) that was promptly dubbed @CAPS3, what could be so funny? One of the things that makes our friendship so important to preserve is how we find humor in every situation when we are together. They thought it was hilarious that I have an irrational fear of seaweed (or river weed, or pond weed, or any type of water weed for that matter ) @PERSON1 that I would yelp or full out scream every time that some touched me. I thought it was fantastic that @PERSON1 just couldn't hold on to her sandals, @PERSON1 would end up making wild dives for them as they floated away. We both thought the way @PERSON1, the @CAPS4 that she is, was reluctant to get wet was preposterous. @PERSON1, naturally, we pushed her in numerous times. These are the things that make our relationship so special. We can be serious for each other when needed, @PERSON1 no one will disrespect my friends @PERSON1 get away with it, but when we are together, I can let my guard down @PERSON1 can be myself. My goofy, irrational, apparently hilarious self, @PERSON1 still have fun.  Our laughter can even change how a situation is going to progress. For example, after we were done on the river, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I went to @ORGANIZATION1 for an afternoon of music @PERSON1 food. We all got enormous ice cream cones, the best money can buy. My friends had already finished theirs, @PERSON1 were playing with @CAPS3 a few yards away. I was just about to take another heavenly lick of my waffle cone when the @CAPS3 the ball flies over @PERSON1 knocks all the ice cream right out of my cone! I was left with a completely intact cone, but all of the good stuff was on the ground. Needless to say, I was devastated. Who knows what would have happened if @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 hadn't started laughing. Maybe I would have teared up, or sulked for an hour or two. However, my face was just so comical, staring in disbelief at the empty cone, that they just couldn't help but laugh. They fell on the grass, in hysterics. Even through my disappointment I started cracking up as well, @PERSON1 then everything seemed okay. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people, or three in my case. My two best friends make me laugh like no other people I have ever met, @PERSON1 I suspect I will never meet anyone else that makes me feel as they do. This laughter we have makes us feel better. It helps us relax @PERSON1 let our guard down, so the times after we laugh together is often when we confide in each other the most. If one of us is feeling down, or is under the weather, laughter is the sure fire way to get them back on their feet @PERSON1 smiling. Even simply being with them makes me feel more exuberant, lets me abandon my troubles. This is why laughter is so important to the the three of us. Whenever we laugh, our relationship builds. It is the good times we have had that help us through the bad times, @PERSON1 I know that our good times wouldn't have been so good were it not for the way we can laugh together.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

While the essay effectively illustrates the role of laughter in building relationships, its content lacks depth and could benefit from further exploration of these experiences. The organization is somewhat disjointed, as the narrative jumps between ideas without clear transitions, which affects the overall flow. Sentence structure varies, but some areas would benefit from more fluid transitions. Word choice is generally appropriate but could be more precise in conveying the author's ideas, and the conventions (grammar and punctuation) need attention, with several minor errors that could be cleaned up for clarity.

It is the parent's responsibility to convey to their children good morals, life skills, and to teach them how to cope and thrive in society. @CAPS24 parenting children requires being firm and strictly reinforcing rules. The result of this however, is the child leaves their parents prepared to live their adult lives outside the home.It is safe to say that although I am a still a teenager, I have learned quite a lot about raising kids. My knowledge mostly being based off of stories passed down to me by my parents and grandparents about their life lessons. Being \"\"in on\"\" these small, yet significant bits of history is quite enjoyable for me. I'd have to say that although many of the facts about the \"\"good old days\"\" are great, it is the almost tangible memories which my family connects with laughter that are the most significant to me. My @CAPS1 grew up in the @DATE1's living in a small yet average sized house with her @CAPS1, @CAPS3, and four brothers and sisters. The main subject which is the focus of the stories my @CAPS1 retells about her childhood come from memories made at the dinner table. It was her @CAPS5's (my @CAPS6's) goal, for his children to learn proper manners and standard etiquette. It was expected of the @PERSON3 children to practice this by being calm, courteous, and mindful of their physical actions when gathered around the table for dinner. For an average, fun, causal, and not so dignified @CAPS7 family, that was a lot to ask. Throughout their childhood my @CAPS1 and her siblings tried their very best to behave and do as they were told at the dinner table. The only common occurrence that was particularly displeasing to my @CAPS6 was when someone spilled their milk. This fateful event happened almost every night. When milk was spilled it was either the cause of a child engaging in funny business, or it was a result of reaching to far to retrieve the butter dish. Whatever the reason, it was somehow hysterically funny when this occurred. The only catch was, that laughing at the table was frowned upon for it seemed to break the formal mood the family strove for during the evening meal. Laughing and spilling milk were two actions not encouraged at the dinner table. Spilling milk did not continue to happen as often as the children grew up, but that is not to say that is discontinued it's presence at the dinner table completely. One night it was not my @CAPS1 nor any of her siblings that spilled their milk. Instead, it was my @CAPS6. When the initial incident occurred, the whole family was in a state of shock. In effort to clean up the mess everyone donated their napkin, while their @CAPS3 maintained a controlled but disgruntled demeanor. When all was cleaned up, the family went on with their meal and on my @CAPS6's face was a subtle yet unmistakable grin. Years later my @CAPS1 (@PERSON4), @PERSON1, @CAPS15 @CAPS16, @PERSON2, and @PERSON2 @CAPS17 grew up, got married, and some even began families of their own. Most of my @CAPS1's family lives in @LOCATION2 so they enjoyed coming up to visit their @CAPS1 and @CAPS3 (my @CAPS21 and @CAPS6) at the holidays or whenever they were able. During these times when the entire family is able to gather here in @LOCATION1, there is hardly ever a somber or serious moment at the dinner table. As my @CAPS3 would say, \"\"@CAPS24 we laugh so hard that tears run down our legs.\"\"  I attribute to the fun we have together to this bond of love that connects us all, and I feel it would not be as prominent without the element of laughter. I feel that my @CAPS6 (who is now in heaven with @CAPS21), accomplished the goal of preparing his children for life. Now that they are all grown up, they can let loose, enjoy each others company, and feel free to bust out in laughter even if there is a risk of someone spilling their milk.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

If I recall the memories correctly, the event began on the day of @CAPS1, when my family gathered for a celebration. The day began normally as any @CAPS1, when all were busy attempting to prepare for a feast, and I lobbying around, careless and oblivious to the world around me. Even so, I am able to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day. It was a sudden burst of joy that finally did me in. A burst of laughter and joy came to me without reason or sanity, I just enjoyed. People, my family, looked upon me with confused eyes, bewildered by my actions and expressions, kept distance from me. Though I continued I still felt a sense of worry, for if I had lost my mind they too would lose faith in my social prowess. For that very day, I noticed a different side to me, a side that I wish would vanish from my being. Never again will I look into a mirror and unto myself, see the sane person I use to acknowledge. The day after the bizarre and unkind gesture I had made among my peers, I attempted to apologize for my actions. Although the first attempt seemed to startle them, seemingly due to the nature of my conversations and excuses made during the short interviews. So onward I continued in my life, again oblivious to my surroundings, yet it differed in my earlier life. I felt a kind and gentle side of myself be released, a relentless stress was lifted from my shoulders and allowed me to continue in my daily life. This is when I noticed another person burrowed into my soul, my alter-ego coming to light and possessing my body. This other being, this alter-ego, I gave the name @PERSON1, and with these new emotions that came with I accomplished great feats. Even today he sometimes comes out in times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance. He gives strength to me, by providing a promise of laughter to me and all peers surrounding me. I view him, as not another person so to say, however as another part of my being. Never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such promise.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Essay: \" Laughter in my life is one of the most important things, because it is often the motivation I need. Whether it be an embarrassing situation that I laugh at looking back on, or when I'm feeling angry and my best friend does something to make me crack up. Sometimes I just feel sad, and if I'm around the right people, the ones who bring the laughter out in me, I know it won't last long. I know that to get my mind off of something, all I need are a few giggle here and there.  Recently, I started going to the gym. I have always been overweight and out of shape, so the gym, like many other attempts, seemed like it wouldn't last long. When taking the tour of my gym originally with my mom, who suggested we try it out, I was pretty excited. Of course this was because it was something new, and I was pumped up enough that I wanted to start that day. My mom, being the more logical one, and of course, the one who would be paying monthly for the membership, wanted to think and talk it over a bit more. In the end, my mom decided that it was right for us. At first my mom kept me motivated. Because I was so out of shape, I got tired after five minutes on the elliptical, at the easiest setting. Seeing my mom beside me on the treadmill, working at it and not even slowing, kept me motivated. Just looking at her made me so happy that every now and then I'd just let out a short burst of laughter, followed by a questioning look from her, but then she would also laugh. Sometimes I thought it was just because I was tired and somewhat delirious from the exertion, but looking back on it now I know I was just happy that my mom and I finally had something to do together. The happy gym days were short-lived, because as usual, my mom was too tired and whatnot to go anymore. I promised myself to go once I was able to drive myself regularly. A few weeks after my birthday, I got my license, but another thing got in the way; my car was a @NUM1-speed, and I only knew @CAPS1 to drive automatic. So after begging my mom almost every day to take me to practice on my new car, she finally took me. In the dark church parking lot, the same one I started driving automatic in, more laughter between us started. She would have me close my eyes and \"\"feel\"\" where the clutch and accelerator @CAPS2 about halfway. At first I thought this was so absurd that I would just start cracking up, and my mom would join in with her laugh. Once I finally got the hang of taking off, which to me is the hardest part, but, like always, laughter was there to make things easier. I learned to drive stick quickly, and because I had made that promise to myself, my first trip for myself was to the gym. My motivation that time was being able to finally do something progressive just for me, and the satisfaction was doing it by myself. The whole way to the gym, I sang @PERSON1 in the twangiest voice I could muster, which led to more laughter. The first few times of going to the gym were based solely on the knowledge that I was doing something good for myself. After about the fourth time, though, my motivation started to dwindle. Instead of listening to my iPod while on the elliptical, I started to watch \"\"@CAPS1 I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4,\"\" because it would get laughs out of me while I was still working my butt off. Before I knew it, the episode was over and I had been going strong for almost an hour, burning @NUM2 calories. I was so impressed with what I had accomplished that it felt like the motivation was fully replenished. I started going daily again. In a week and a half, I had lost @NUM3 pounds just by going to the gym, working out, and most of all, laughing. Part of it was self-motivation, but another part was the laughter that so easily distracted me from the task at hand. Because I had been getting into shape, I was also able to increase the \"\"@CAPS5\"\" level on the machine, and am still going every day. Each day it feels easier and easier, and now I have \"\"@CAPS6\"\" and \"\"@CAPS7 @CAPS8\"\" to make me laugh even more while working out. I believe that in many cases, laughter has saved me.

I am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girls. I'm writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share @CAPS2. Honestly I depend on a good laugh during my day. Without laughter life would never be the same for me. Laughing has brought me to who I am today. Not only has @CAPS2 made me the person I am but @CAPS2 has brought me to all my friends and the people I love. For example I use laughter between me and my boyfriend @PERSON1.  @PERSON1 and I are just like any other couple. We have fun, do stuff together and we argue. The worst part is when we fight. just like everyone else we have hard time and we have good times. Our hard times all start when we wake up. When i wake up its still really dark outside. The smell of fresh @TIME1 air makes me feel refreshed. I always feel like the happiest girl in the world. A little while after i wake up i text @PERSON1 good @TIME1 and we usually, always talk through out the @TIME1. Some times he comes to see me or i just see him at school. When i see him i am happy and my toes curl. We will go for a walk and talk about everything and anything, just life. At this point he thinks its time to say something funny. So he does, he will make fun of how i look, what i am wearing and what i say. He doesn't find @CAPS2 hurtful but to me @CAPS2 is. Many times i might even say something mean back which doesn't help @CAPS2 just makes @CAPS2 worse.  Not long goes by, maybe a few seconds and we start to fight. He doesn't understand he has hurt me or he doesn't care. @PERSON1 tells me he has done nothing wrong. So i try to explain @CAPS2 and he doesn't listen. I just stop trying and if he realizes how he hurt me or what happened that bothered me that's fine but i am not going to fight anymore so i just stop explaining things. Enough has gone through my mind so i cry, and he gives me a dumbness look. This just makes everything worse so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse. There is yelling and screaming with tears and mean, rotten words tossed all over the place its a mess. I usually storm of in the middle @CAPS2 cause i cant take anymore.  Finally time goes by and we haven't talked all day. We don't have anything to say to each other. Eventually someone gets the nerve to talk or say something to another. Still each of us on edge so i say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood. I will do anything to see a smile on his face, even if we have done each other wrong i still love him and cant stand for @CAPS2 to be like this anymore. Of course he smiles, just what i was looking for this makes me happy and laugh. @PERSON1 will than ask for a hug and so he hugs me even if i don't answer or if i say no, @CAPS2 doesn't matter to him. He apologizes and explains a couple things to me. I feel bad cause i hate the stress and the fight, so we work @CAPS2 out.  Now you can see if i didn't have laughter i might be depressed. Without laughter things would be harder and more complicated. But a good laugh or a simple joke can ease things and make them a lot better in life. I just want people to understand what a small laugh can do to your day. If @CAPS2 can change your day in such a big way than @CAPS2 can change your life in a major way. Things @MONTH1 come across as hard of rough. When i look back on my life and see what @CAPS2 has done to me and for me i realize i laughed at something each one of those days even though i was done and @CAPS2 brought me back up again.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

The sun was out and shineing on the creek that me, my twin brother and my best friend were swimming in. The creek was fantastic. It was a deep swimming hole that all the neighborhood kids would swim in. Since all the other kids were either too old and busy to swim, or they were too young it was just us three that swam in the creek that @DATE1. We loved it. It helped cool us down during the heat of the day. We would play games like @PERSON1, and tag in the water. There was even a rope swing off the little brigde that one of the older kids made. The swimming hole was the place to be that @DATE1.  Eventually we got hungry and tired of swimming in the hole for a while. There was this trail we would use to walk back to my house. The trail was the fastest way to get home. From the trail you could see farm animals grazing in the sun filled fields. The day we walked this trail was a little different then normall. All the farm animals were making noise. One of the farm hands was walking the trail listening for a bell. He said one of his goats had gotten out. He warned us that the goat was alittle mean and if we saw it to keep our distance. So we took the warning and walked on. Once we reached the gravel road that lead to my house, @PERSON2 said she heard the bell. My brother and I didnt believe her at all. We thought she was playing another joke on us. We walked on for about @NUM1 seconds. All of the sudden @PERSON2 screamed run! My brother and i turned around and saw the white goat with big horns chasing us! We ran as fast as we could. I tripped over my feet and fell. I got up as fast i could and sprinted faster. I could tell my adrenaline was up because I was running really fast and i wasn't getting tired. We reached the hotwire fence that surround my house. We all stopped and questioned if we could jump over it or not. The goat was getting closer and closer, we didn't have much time to deside weather we could or not. My brother was the first to jump. Of course he made it and soo did @ORGANIZATION2. I was the last one. I started to panic in my head. I backed up alittle and ran and jumped over the fence. I thought i was gonna make it but then my foot caught the fence and i flung over the fence and face planted it. It was super embbarrasing. My friend and brother were both laughing histarically at me. I could tell my face was beat red and i was mad that i fell. Again. Although i still found myself laughing. The goat had stopped at the fence and started to charge it with his horns. That made me jump and run. I dived over a row boat were my brother and friend was and I said oh my lanta that was the funniest most scareiest thing i had experianced all @DATE1. We walked up to the house laughing and talking about eachothers faces as we where running and how funny it was that i face planted it. They made fun of the face i made when the goat started to charge the fence. Even though i was embarrased that i tripped over the fence, I still found my self laughing and making fun of myself for what had happened. I would have to say that was the best day all @DATE1. We got up to my house and went into the kitchen to find my mom laughing so hard that she was crieing. We all asked her what was soo funny and she said she saw the whole thing from the window. We all started laughing to point we all cried. We all told the story the story to our parents when they all came over for dinner and they laughed and laughed.

Let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call \"\"good times.\"\" I will tell you how laughter is a big part in my family. And how embarrassment is involved. It is a beautiful sunny day @CAPS3 @DATE1. Today was a big day for me, @ORGANIZATION2. It was the day I was going to have my @CAPS1 party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ORGANIZATION1 and sat down @CAPS3 a chair to have my hair done. I was wearing my @PERSON1 pajamas with a black shirt that said \"\"@CAPS2 @CAPS3.\"\" I got my hair done, did my make-up, put my dress @CAPS3, went outside to take pictures, and got @CAPS3 the limousine so I could go to church. After I went to church I took pictures with my family and then went to @CAPS4 to take pictures at the @ORGANIZATION3 building. After we got back from @CAPS4, I went to the @ORGANIZATION1, at @CAPS6, and got ready for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my court of honor; six guys and six girls and my partner. After the waltz I danced the second waltz with my dad. When I was done dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner and towards the end came the big part... I was supposed to be picked up by my girls and the guys were supposed to spell my name @CAPS7 ran in front of me and the girls when one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong! The guys were supposed to spell \"\"@ORGANIZATION2\"\", with two guys wearing black @CAPS3 each end, but @CAPS7 ended up spelling \"\"@CAPS8\"\"! One of the other guys saw the mistake right away, so he moved to the left and since my uncle didn't move to the left either, @CAPS7 ended up spelling \"\"@CAPS9\"\"! I'm am not going to lie...I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong spot because the letters were facing my way, but I could of stopped that from happening but I didn't because I couldn't! But at the end it was funny. Everybody in there started laughing and I got so embarrassed! But when I was walking off the dance floor I started laughing! Now that we think about it, that is the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family. I guess laughter really is there when something embarrassing happens. Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. But laughter is always there when we have an embarrassing moment. Laughter is always with us. It doesn't matter if we mean to or not, but we end up doing something dumb that makes us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family. Laughter is with me because my family is fun, crazy, and cool. No matter how sad we are, it doesn't matte if we are sad because one of my family members were in a car accident or someone died, we remember the times when we were happy and when we were having fun with that person. We end up remembering the fun we had together, that we start laughing really hard! Laughter is there when we are happy, but it is also there when it is the best day of your life.

We were there for @CAPS9 @NUM1 minutes just laughing @CAPS9 all the crazy stuff that has happened over @DATE1 already! When we were finally giving hugs to go to @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @LOCATION2's older brother, smacked @PERSON1 on her butt and told her it was nice. We made fun of her for the longest time for that! Not to mention how @CAPS3 kept talking @CAPS9 that until he moved to @ORGANIZATION2.  When we left, @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 and I were singing to @ORGANIZATION2's new @CAPS5 when some random person stopped and asked for directions. Then I directed him to where he was going and he said, \"\"@CAPS6 you,\"\" and drove away. When he had gone, @PERSON4 looked at me and screamed, \"\"That was the hottest guy I have @CAPS7 seen!\"\" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 the time we reached the @CAPS10 down the road we saw the guy again. @CAPS8 this time he wasn't so hot. He had a scruffy face and long, brown, straggly hair tied in a ponytail and was dressed like a hobo. I, still to this day, give her crap @CAPS9 it. That was the greatest @TIME1 of @DATE1.  We ended up going to the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 to buy some drinks when @PERSON1 started freaking out @CAPS9 losing her @CAPS5. So we all had to retrace our steps all the way back to @LOCATION2's house, hoping we'd find it. Re-retracing our steps, we came across this guy who tried to help us find it. By then it was probably @CAPS9 @NUM1 @CAPS14'clock @LOCATION4. We finally gave up and decided to head back to @ORGANIZATION1. Before We even stepped foot in her front door, her mom comes darting out and starts screaming at @LOCATION3. So her mom took me and @PERSON4 back to my house @CAPS8 by the time I knocked on the door, because it was locked, and everyone was asleep so we had no where to go. So for that @TIME1 @PERSON4 and I were stuck homeless. We walked around all @TIME1. Almost fell asleep in the laundromat when i remembered that my aunt @PERSON3 was looking at a small, white truck for sale in the @CAPS15 parking lot. The truck had a bed in the back, no, i don't know why, and it sounded better than the hard floor of the laundromat so we crawled in.  It was a tight squeeze, @CAPS8 we managed. Plus it wreaked of dirty socks and pee. It was, for sure, the worst thing 've @CAPS7 smelled. @CAPS8 no doubt was it the funnest @TIME1 I've had with that girl.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

I believe that @CAPS7 is one of the most important part of any relationship. @CAPS7's what brings people together. A perfect example; about two years ago in the middle of fall, I was crying about my dog passing away. My ex-boyfriend tried everything to make me feel better but nothing was working. I was so hurt I told him I just wanted to be alone and he understood. As he was walking away he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoonSpongebob @CAPS1, when @ORGANIZATION1 slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his entire back-side was drenched. His cheeks were cherry-red with embarrassment. I just busted out laughing, I couldn't help @CAPS7. He saw that water had gotten all over me, then he started laughing. That was a moment of comfort brought on by laughter. Whenever we had a promblem, we could always laugh @CAPS7 off. That's actually how I met him. I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and we decided to go see a movie calledStep-@CAPS2. There was this one seen where one of the characters said, \"\"@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur,\"\" then other character looked like he was going to cry. I thought that was so funny. After the movie was over my friend @PERSON1 suggested that we go back to his house. When we got there, @CAPS4 was waiting on the steps for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 stood back a second then said, \"\"aw were you waiting for me little one.\"\" @CAPS4 replied with, \"\"@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny , last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur.\"\" I laughed so hard I almost went the bathroom on myself. @CAPS4 and myself were the only ones laughing and we just clicked. If he wasn't funny I can honestly say I would've never been with him. I love laughter. I believe @CAPS7's the easiest way to trigger the best emotions.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak @CAPS2 \"\"language\"\" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into @CAPS2 world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on @CAPS2 particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a \"\"bunny trail\"\" and @CAPS4 was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving \"\"black eyes\"\" of sorts to both teams. @CAPS4 was right and I knew it, but did @CAPS4 really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, \"\"@CAPS1 @CAPS4 hadn't done what @CAPS4 did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill.\"\" @CAPS2 was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that.  \"\"That only happenedone time!\"\"@CAPS4 declared as @CAPS4 tried to defended herself. \"\"@CAPS3 way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!\"\" \"\"I didn't tell the world,\"\" I objected. \"\"I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on.\"\"@CAPS4 raised her eyebrow in a manner as @CAPS1 to say, \"\"@CAPS5? You @CAPS6 know what I'm talking about.\"\" The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going no where and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS4 was done with me, I was done with her. @CAPS4 leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to loose her footing. All the cool @CAPS4 once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, @CAPS4 met the unforgiving, stone floor with a @CAPS7! which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as @CAPS1 they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what @CAPS4 thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, @CAPS4 managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and @CAPS4 accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. \"\"@CAPS8,\"\" @CAPS4 managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day.  \"\"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.\"\" That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same \"\"language.\"\"\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

Another thing we would do to make our self laugh would be when @PERSON1 and I would have big tickle fights. It would always start with one of us trying to stick something in each others mouths. I would always try to stick a piece of paper in her mouth and to get me to stop, @PERSON1 would tickle me. @PERSON1 new that I'm like the ticklish person on the face of the planet. One time that happened was when we where in front of the office at our school. We tickled and tickled each other till we where laughing our butts off on the flour. Well a teacher came and told us to stop and then the bell rang and so we just went to our classes. Well @PERSON1 was the office aid and so when she went to the office, apparently one of the office people saw us tickling each other and thought we where going out. @PERSON1 told me that she just said \"\"@CAPS3\"\" and started to chuckle. I got a big laugh out of that. Laughter is a vary good thing to me because without it, @PERSON1 and I wouldn't be best friends as we are today in @NUM2 grade. You see, our friendship all started off of laughter. I met @PERSON1 in the sixth grade @CAPS4 class. Our teacher had assigned seats and @PERSON1 and I and two other people had to sit together. I had no idea who she was at the time. We ended up saying something and laughing about it and soon enough she introduced her self and so did I. Well the seating arrangement changed and she sat somewhere ells and so did I. Well the person she sat by moved away. I had a bad grade in @CAPS4 class and I told my teacher I wasn't getting along with the people at my table and asked if I could sit somewhere ells. He told me yes and so I went over and asked @PERSON1 if I could sit in the empty chair that the guy used to sit in before he moved away. She told me that she didn't care and so then on out we started hanging in school together and had so much fun.  So you see. Laughter is a grate deal in a lot of peoples life's. You need it. Without it I would of never made my best friend who I have today. I have her to thank for getting me through my tough years. Without the laughter in this world we would be lost probably. Just think about what you might not have or what you might be missing if you didn't have laughter in your life.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion, and laughter. For my sister @PERSON3 and I, laughter is what made our relationship stronger than it ever would. When I was younger it was the typical older sister @LOCATION1 younger sister vibe, frankly we did not like each other at all. Through maturing, entering high school, and being part of the same cheer leading organization we have spent almost too much time together and now it's almost as if we are the best of friends. In the @DATE3 we were together constantly. We would watchJerry @PERSON1, laugh and/or make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show. We would watch clips of the showSaturday @TIME1 @CAPS1, that's where I introduced her to the character \"\"@CAPS2\"\". @PERSON3 and I would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from \"\"@CAPS2\"\" and laugh constantly about @NUM1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 is also where we adapted the \"\"demonic voice\"\". We would talk to each other, and our friends in these voices. Both of us still talk like that @DATE1. As we entered high school we had to start driving together everyday to and from school. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves and sometimes I would have to steer if her favorite song came on(she was a very energetic dancer). It was all in good fun though. When we would enter into the school everything would change though and I understood that after about a week. I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hi to her in the hall or wave at her when she was around her friends. She wanted to be left alone so she wouldn't look weird. She was a junior then, they always think their the coolest around. Once she was a senior she would say hi to me, she would smile when she saw me, I even talked to her and her friends sometime. We also grew closer once I entered the student leadership class that she was also apart of, we had the same class every other day it was hard not to talk to each other.  The single thing that I believe has made our relationship closer because of laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room. She decided to \"\"move in\"\" when she would wake up in the morning with bug bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea what they were from. We suspected that she just didn't remember getting them when she was out the @TIME1 before, but then when she wouldn't go out she still got them. We figured out what it was when her friend @PERSON2 came over; she had bed bugs. That @TIME1 I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two three nights tops so my parents had time to disinfect her room. That turned into two three weeks. We spend almost every hour of every day together those three weeks, the only peace I got was in the shower. We would stay up late talking about our day, who we didn't like, who's outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in cheer practice and who could have done better at cheering. If you knew @PERSON3 you would know how scared she gets over a movie so half the time when we were up late I was next to her trying to scare her. It's quite funny to see her reaction. Finally she \"\"moved out\"\" and I got my room back though I don't think, even now it feels the same as it did. They say many things about laughter; \"\"Laughter is the best medicine\"\" \"\"Laughter is the shortest distance between people\"\" \"\"@CAPS5 two people in a room, they'll be laughing in @NUM2 minutes\"\"; All of these talking about how relationships grow with laughter. I have the funniest, silliest, greatest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things. We have the same mind people say, we do a lot of the same things, we think a lot alike, and we wear a lot of the same things as well. I am positive laughter has strengthened my sister and I's relationship. I bet if you really look at the relationship between you and someone you're close to, the first memory you think of is a happy moment of you laughing.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

The narrative contains relatable anecdotes that capture the evolution of their bond, emphasizing how humor brought them closer despite initial differences. The content is engaging, and the personal stories give a strong sense of intimacy and connection. However, there are several areas for improvement. To deepen the content, the writer could provide more reflection on how these moments of laughter shaped their relationship over time or discuss the emotional significance behind certain events. The organization could be tighter; transitions between anecdotes feel abrupt, and the essay could benefit from clearer structure and focus. Sentence fluency is generally fine, but occasional awkward phrasing or repetitive elements detract from the flow. Word choice is functional, though a more varied vocabulary could help elevate the writing. Several grammatical and punctuation issues also impact the overall readability, so paying attention to these conventions would strengthen the essay.

A story about laughter is what you want to hear? Well my life is filled with laughter and smiling. Crazy I know! If it wasn't for laughing I would not have the six pack that I have today. Have you ever stopped to think about when one person can make another person laugh they usually become really close friends maybe even best friends? My boyfriend is my best friend. This one time my boyfriend and I were laughing so hard. My boyfriend is my life. I spend pretty much everyday with him, he is so amazing. Me and him well we do everything together. He is very close to me. He is the best best friend anyone could ask for! I've only known him for about a year, a lot can happen in one year. You can meet new people, build relationships, and even move away from those relationships you just made. Me and @PERSON1 we are always laughing, at each other and at other things as well. We always have fun times with each other. It was a late @DATE1 @TIME1 and he was walking me home like he always did before. There is this field with extremely tall grass and we were walking right next to it. All of a sudden out of no where he acts like he is getting pulled into the grass. So guess what I did, I screamed as loud as I could possibly scream! Then he starts calling my name in a creepy voice telling me to come over to the grass. Out of curiosity of what just happened I start walking over towards the tall grass. When I arrived to the spot where he entered the grass he tells me \"\"@CAPS1 I lost my shoe and I can't seem to find it anywhere!\"\" @PERSON1 and I start looking everywhere for his shoe. We couldn't see anything because it was really dark, so we used our hands to search around for his shoe, \"\"I found it!\"\" I said. After we found the shoe we realized two hours went by. We were so tired we laid down in the grass to take and break and we both started cracking up with laughter because of how ridiculous it was that we spent two hours on something that was suppose to be a little joke! it was so awesome. When we finally got to our feet our bellies hurt so bad and were very sore. I have never laughed harder than that in my life. Every time I'm with @PERSON1 is the best time ever. We always seem to find a way to make each other laugh. Without best friends or even just friends you would probably find it hard to laugh. With friends you always have someone to laugh at and also laugh with. This is why i cherish my best friend @PERSON1 and all the happy and laughing times we have together, because you'll never know when the last time you'll see that person will be. I try to be as happy as I can and I try to always make people laugh because laughter is the best way of exercise.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

We talk about everything and even if it is the saddest thing in the world we will be able to make it funny in a way, it's just one of those things we do. As best friends it's our job to make each other feel better, and if one calls the other crying it's their job to make the them laugh and if it is funny for both @CAPS2 know it was a job well done. In @DATE3, my uncle died, I called her crying my eyes out, she said, everything was going to be okay and to just think of all the good memories I had of him. One of the only ones I could think of was the funniest story of my life and even though I was still crying, through those tears there was laughter and I knew my uncle would want me to laugh and he was right there laughing with me.  @PERSON1 and I met @DATE1, at @ORGANIZATION1, where we spent a week out of our @DATE1 to get to know new people and getting closer to @CAPS1. That week was one of the funniest weeks out of my whole @DATE1, though me and @PERSON1 didn't \"\"click\"\" at @ORGANIZATION1 that week, we later found out we were more alike then we thought. Some people say when two people are to much alike the friendship doesn't work. Well, this is true yet false. When @CAPS2 are alike @CAPS2 can talk to each other about everything, yet when @CAPS2 hit those differences, and the other disagrees it starts a fight, but fights just bring people closer together.  Even though me and @PERSON1 don't see each other much, doesn't mean we can't be best friends. What if your best friend lived in a different state, does that mean they aren't your best friend anymore? No, it just means @CAPS2 don't see them as much as @CAPS2 would like to. Even though we live close to each other we don't always have time to see one another, but, when we do finally get to see each other there isn't a dull moment. About a month after @PERSON1 had gotten in a bad car accident, we went to skate world, @PERSON1 was on crutches so she couldn't skate, but that didn't stop her from having fun and making the @TIME1 full of laughter. She was up dancing to the music, on top of seats yelling, \"\"@CAPS2 wont ever see these people again in your life, why not just have a little fun? \"\". By the @DATE2 @TIME1 she got almost everyone in our group dancing up on the stools and I don't regret one thing that happened that @TIME1, it was the most I had laughed in about a year. We were dancing and screaming for about three hours, before one the parents got their and after that we all went home. That is a @TIME1 I will never forget. A girl that was recovering from a horrible car accident made the best out of what she had!  When things don't work out the way we wanted, we just go on with life wishing that it had happen differently, but when we look back a couple years down the road we will see that it was just fine, and it @MONTH1 just make @CAPS2 laugh. somethings are hard to laugh about, but a good thing to do when @CAPS2 get to that point is think of something happy, or funny and try to laugh. Laughing has always made me feel better, and knowing that I can make someone with a difficult life laugh until they are about to pee makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I have done something good with my life that I was willing to help @PERSON1 with her struggles. To me that makes this life, a life worth living. Though @CAPS2 cant help everyone through every single one of their struggles, just being there sometimes helps them more then @CAPS2 @MONTH1 know.  @PERSON1 and I have planed out many lives we would like to live and looking back now on them all I can do is laugh, because in my heart I know they will never happen. Even if we try our best to make them happen I doubt they will. But, it was worth the laughter and a good time to make them up, and Believe they were going to happen for awhile and I know looking back in a few years we will both laugh. Laughing is a good way to get rid of fear, anger, and stress. It makes @CAPS2 think of all the good times @CAPS2 have had in your life, and lets @CAPS2 know that @CAPS2 had fun in your life. Though we fight, in the @DATE2, I don't think anyone will be able to tear @PERSON1 and I apart, with all the laughter that is done.

Word choice is generally effective, creating vivid imagery, though some phrases could be improved for clarity.

Laughter is something that can be shared among people especially when they're in the dumps. This emotion is the one that will brighten up anyday and bring enjoyment. Laughter has been a huge part of my life. From family, friends, boyfriends, and stangers laughing has always been a big deal to me. I love being able to look at someone and see that they smile alot, which means that they probaly laugh alot and that they are a happy person. How can I tell this. Well for starters there is dimples in their cheeks and crows feet in the corner of their eyes. Really the crows feet don't matter about how old you are they can happen from laughing, smiling all the time, and squinting in the sun. The biggest part of laughter that has contributed to my life is having a relationship. Usually when you have laughter in the relationship it will make it last longer. The reason the relationships will last longer is because you can be yourself and let the other person see that you are fine with laughing and being part of their life. I believe that laughing in an relationship is the best part. Lets say your partner is in the dumps, are you just going to let them be moody all day or are you going to try to make them laugh and cheer them up. When I'm in a relationship and my partner is being moody I try my hardest to cheer them up. I love to make people laugh. And when I'm being a grouch my boyfriend is helpful and tries to make me feel better or they just comfort me to see what is wrong. So if there is not laughter in your relationship then obviously there will be no happiness. Therefore it will not work out between you and the person you're with. So spread the joyfullness of life and and make people happy. Another part that laughter that has been in my life is friends. If you don't know me well let me tell you I'm shy at first, but once I warm up to you, you'll see that I'm a very outgoing person. Like most of my friends will say is that I am weird, but I enjoy laughing alot and making others laugh too. When I'm around my friends and in the dumps someone will always in the end will get me to laugh. No matter how upset I am they can always get me to laugh at pretty much anything, since I am a really easy person to entertain. Being around these people is like watching a comedy movie or act. They are always finding some way to be funny and annoying. Such as being obnoxious and doing stupid things that others will never do because it's embarassing. Well just because it is embarassing doesn't mean you shouldn't at least do it. If you don't do it, it will give us more to do and give us all the attention to ourselves. How are you suppose to know whether or not it's funny if you don't want to try something new. How are you suppose to laugh at yourself and have others laugh with and at you no matter how stupid it is. So don't knock it until you try it. The person that once said, \"\" laughter is the shortest distance between two people.\"\" is it true or false? Is this really the shortest distance or the longest? I honestly believe that is could be the a short distance. You don't want to be snooty or crabby all the time or you will never make friends or have any relationships. And if you don't have friends or any relationships then who will make you laugh and enjoy yourself. If you're not a happy person then how are you to experience the joys of life and everything around you. You won't, so put a smile on you face and be a spontaneous person who is not afraid. Laughter is a benefit to all man kind. And laughter in my life has showed me so much, it has brought me and others so much experience to enjoy. Those enjoyments that have been explored, are having boyfriends, friends, and family around me all the time. This is one emotion that is definitely one that will brighten up anyday and bring happy expressions to every ones faces.

Most perfect days in people's teenage years are in the @DATE3 beyond the stress of school. My perfect day wasn't in the @DATE3, nor was it on a crazy @DATE4 break in @LOCATION2. My perfect day was on a @DATE2 in the middle of @MONTH1 in @DATE1. It was on this perfect day that my friendship with @ORGANIZATION1 was founded. A friendship that is now the best one of all. A friendship that is based on fun times, memories, story telling, and laughter. By @DATE1 I had spent multiple weekends with @ORGANIZATION1. However none were as hot as that weekend in late @DATE4. We decided we needed to cool off and with that said, we set off for @CAPS1. Down the road we went with two redneck boys and a mutt in the truck bed. Arriving in @CAPS1 was peculiar because I was so far out of my comfort zone. It was also peculiar because I hadn't met a single soul @ORGANIZATION1 was about to introduce me to. When I first lay my eyes on @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 I couldn't fathom how @ORGANIZATION1 had met them. She is athletic, driven, proper, and intelligent. The boys that shook my hand were into things like big trucks, fishing poles, and a loud country band. I didn't think upon first meeting them that opposites could attract or become fond of one another. As the day progressed I found my comfort zone again. As the hours flew by and jokes and laughs were exchanged, I realized just how similar we all really were. I didn't think that all of the childish things we did that @DATE2 in @MONTH1 would matter to me months down the roads, but they do. When we were running by the dirty creek with black lipstick painted on as war paint and laughing so hard we cried, I realized just how perfect the situation was. If that day wouldn't have brought laughs to my lips and my mind to it's comfort zone, it would have been a day long forgotten. If you go back on every happy memory you have, there is always one common ground. A joke, or even a funny face makes you laugh extremely hard. Every time I drive through @CAPS1 I think about the day when the sun was hot and we sat by fishing poles exchanging laughs. I think about @ORGANIZATION1 and I running through the trees laughing and tripping over our own feet. I think about @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 laughing and pointing as we attempted to go swimming.  After all of the crazy running and swimming we were quite wound up. @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 asked us to take a walk; so we accepted and off we went into the brush. Within five minutes of our departure, we stopped walking. Our walk had put us on the top of a hill of little round pebbles. I'm not sure what events lead up to @LOCATION1 pushing @PERSON1 down the hill. However, I remember @PERSON1 pulling @PERSON2 down with him. I also recall @PERSON4 sliding down to join the battle. Watching three boys wrestle and play on a hill of sliding rocks was something like watching a movie about the fifties. Nobody was texting or messing with a machine. Around us was laughing and serenity which danced like music around us. The day had no stress and it had the perfect amount of sunshine. It was like something you only dream about. Once you are in a moment like that, where your own little world is pulling you closer, you never want to leave it. When your on the laughing high, you disconnect yourself and for a few brief seconds your life is in it's simplest form. You are simply you, no racing thoughts, no rushing emotions. You are just one person. I never thought that something as small as laughs could create or better a friendship. On that @DATE2 I realized that the laughs shared between @ORGANIZATION1 and I would be the first memory for what was to come. Every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something I think about when I'm doubtful of the world. It'll always be a memory that makes me appreciate living. Someone once said, \"\"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.\"\" @CAPS4 that @DATE1 I wouldn't have believed it but laughing made me closer with people I would have otherwise avoided. Laughs and smiles bounded my world into @ORGANIZATION1 and into the world of a few @CAPS1 rednecks. And as of a @DATE1 @TIME1, that has made all the difference.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

Honestly, you can laugh with any age or gender. You don't both have @CAPS5 be @NUM1 and female, you could be with a little boy, an elderly lady, or anywhere in between and still have a lot of fun. Last @DATE1 I never had anything @CAPS5 do, so I decided I should start volunteering places. The two places I could volunteer at were: a daycare next @CAPS5 my house, or an old folks home about @NUM2 miles away. I thought really hard about it, trying @CAPS5 make the best decision for me. I couldn't make up my mind, and even though I didn't admit it, I felt like they would be just as boring as sitting at home. I finally decided I should do both of them, so I could meet some new people, and have new experiences. I started with the daycare. I woke up at @NUM3 am, and walked @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION1. I wasn't sure what it was going @CAPS5 be like at all. I didn't even know if i was good with kids. I walked in, and stood @CAPS3 awkwardly. The @ORGANIZATION1 manager came up @CAPS5 me and asked me if i could help out with the @NUM4 year old's coloring room. I nodded my head nervously.  Was i supposed @CAPS5 color for them? @CAPS3's no way they could color a picture by themselves. They're only three! I thought. Oh well, if i follow directions then this day will get @CAPS2 faster. When i went in @CAPS3 all the kids ran up @CAPS5 me with a smile on their face. \"\"@CAPS1 by me!\"\" one said. \"\"@CAPS2 here!\"\" said another. \"\"@CAPS3's a spot right here!\"\" \"\"@CAPS4 at my picture!\"\" \"\"I drew a rainbow!\"\" \"\"I drew a car!\"\" \"\"I drew you!\"\" @CAPS5 that, i looked down. @CAPS3 i was, on the piece of paper. A bunch of blue and green scribbles. That day was a lot of fun. I was laughing and having a great time with the kids. I learned that i absolutely adore kids, and I'm actually pretty good with them. The next week a went @CAPS5 the nursing home. I was even more nervous @CAPS3. I felt so out of place. I hadn't found out what I was going @CAPS5 be helping with yet, so I sat on a chair in the lobby. When the receptionist asked who i was her @CAPS5 see, i said nobody. She then asked me why I was here, and I replied, oh, I was going @CAPS5 volunteer. She led me down the hall told me that it was almost time for lunch so i needed @CAPS5 get ready @CAPS5 serve lunch. I did, and then the i heard, what i assumed was, the lunch bell. I gave everyone their lunch with a big smile and it was honestly great. If one of them looked a little down, or upset I could flash them a smile and they would grin back, obviously in higher spirits than before. After lunch, I played a few games of chess. Most people who were @CAPS3 took naps after lunch, so @CAPS3 were only three people out @CAPS3. I played first with a lady who used @CAPS5 be a nurse. I got @CAPS5 know her pretty well in the half hour we played the game; which i won. Next was a guy who was a veteran. He fought in the @LOCATION1 war. He seemed really nice, but serious. I won that game too. The last man used @CAPS5 be a comedian. He was so funny. He told jokes the whole game! Maybe he said a few @CAPS5 many, because he beat me at chess. Well that was my excuse. When i got done, i was in a great mod and i could't wait @CAPS5 come back again. I learned a lot that @DATE1. I found out everyone is alike in some ways, even though each person is unique. I realized you don't have @CAPS5 be the same as the person your with, @CAPS5 laugh and have a good time. It doesn't matter what age, race, gender, size, mentality, maturity, etc. The only thing that matters is that you are in the same place at the same time, trying @CAPS5 make the best of your day.

Conventions are somewhat followed, but there are noticeable errors in capitalization, punctuation, and word choice that detract from the clarity and professionalism of the writing. The essay does a good job addressing the prompt and highlighting the significance of laughter, though it could benefit from deeper reflection on how the experiences influenced the writer's views. Language is somewhat expressive, though refining it would enhance the overall impact. While narratively solid, more sensory details and smoother transitions would elevate the essay's cohesion. The essay presents a personal story well but needs further refinement in clarity, structure, and conventions to make a more polished impression."}]}

We do everything together and we always have each others back. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each others throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that did not seem humorous at first, but as the event came to an end it quickly became humorous.  The story starts at @TIME1 as i arrived at the school to depart on a grueling five hour bus ride to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the following day. I slept for a solid @TIME1 hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 so i just turned on my @CAPS5 and listened to music the rest of the way. When we finally arrived at our @CAPS13, we were instructed to go work off some extra weight before we could eat dinner.   After we had finished working out, we set off to get some dinner that way long overdue at this point. I was with my best friends, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, both with appetites as big as mine. We past many fast food restaurants, but we did not want any old burger, we wanted the masterpiece that is called a @ORGANIZATION1. We had heard rumor that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 establishment somewhere in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, so we set out on our journey to @ORGANIZATION1.We walked a good two miles along a highway, and took a few random alleys that we thought were shortcuts. I started to feel like we should go back and search more around the @CAPS13, but against my better judgment we trudged forward towards where we thought the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was.   We soon found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets. We tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones back at our @CAPS13 so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were more old, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unfamiliar. We were all scared, but we masked our fears in hopes of not starting a state of panic.  We were all guessing that is was about nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. This sent us into a panic more that anything. Our minds filled with images of our coach screaming at us with all his might, then making us run an agonizing five miles. We started frantically running down streets and alleys in hopes of seeing a familiar scene. After not seeing anything, and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. The fear that was once masked, was now clearly visible in all of our faces.   We came upon a digital billboard that displayed the time, and temperature. We only had ten minutes to make it back to our @CAPS13 or our fate was sealed. We began running again praying that we would arrive back on time. As we ran, we came upon the side of a big @CAPS13. We did not know the name of the @CAPS13 we were staying at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the front counter informed us that were were now at the @CAPS13 @NUM1, but she had just started her shift and did not know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked out the door, we were greeted with a strong slap to the head. we turned in shock to see our coach, red at a beat, pointing at his watch. We had almost made it, only @TIME1 minutes late.   after being screamed at for a solid twenty minutes, he sent us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead of us. I was about to crawl in bed when i glanced out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply longed for; the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1. My friends and I immediately broke into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost searching for the treasure that is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and it turned out the treasure was in our own back yard. We hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place. I never got to sink my teeth into one of those tasty, succulent @ORGANIZATION1, but we did have a very funny and ironic experience that still makes me laugh to this very moment.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

We laugh together, we breathe together, and we'll die together. When it comes to a family the most important thing that brings @CAPS1 as one besides having fun, loving each other, and spending quality time together is what makes @CAPS1 laugh and what keeps @CAPS1 close. For me, my siblings, and parents we always have to have a good time and laugh, whether one is upset or the other is mad. It doesn't matter what the situation is @CAPS3's always a time where we have the best times even @CAPS2 points when one of us doesn't want to see one another. I was spending an adventurous day with one of my close friends, @LOCATION1 and we decided it was time to go home and get ready so I could go spend the night @CAPS2 her house. When @LOCATION1 and I stepped in my house @CAPS3 was so much commotion going on and yelling that we decided maybe we should sit down and figure out what was going on. As we sat down we began to bust up laughing @CAPS2 the sight of my step dad, @PERSON1 yelling @CAPS2 my oldest sister, @ORGANIZATION1. We didn't know what had just happened, but we really wanted to find out. \"\"I can't believe @CAPS1 just can't go next door to @PERSON2's house and ask for toilet paper when I've been sitting anxiously on the toilet with hope @CAPS1 would bring me toilet paper for an hour. Yet, they came to our house and asked for our plunger which is far more embarrassing,\"\" @PERSON1 said. As soon as those words violently came out of his mouth we started cracking up laughing. It felt like my stomach was tightening so much that I couldn't breathe. With as much attitude as @CAPS1 can put in your tone of voice, @ORGANIZATION1 had said, \"\"@CAPS1 don't need toilet paper to clean yourself with! @CAPS1 could have easily hopped in the shower and used the shower head to wash off the poop!\"\" @CAPS2 that point @CAPS3 was no going back @CAPS2 what she had said. My step dad was furious that she would even say such a thing. Without any hesitation @CAPS6 quickly picked up the phone and dialed my mothers number. Waiting, and waiting for her to pick up. Suddenly, @LOCATION1 and I heard a voice on the phone. @PERSON1 began screaming telling my mom about the situation. It got to a point where @CAPS6 said some words that @CAPS6 shouldn't have said. As the words rolled off his tongue @CAPS6 began to stutter. @CAPS6 spoke, \"\"@CAPS3 was no toilet paper and @ORGANIZATION1 wouldn't go and grab me some from @PERSON2's house. Unfortunately, I had to get up, get my hand wet, and wash my hands after I wiped my butt with my own hand.\"\" @CAPS3 was no stopping us from laughing as hard as we could. I had never heard of something so disgusting that made me want to throw up all over our leather couches.  @CAPS6 was so anxious to take my sister's phone away that @CAPS6 immediately asked for it before confronting my mother about it. @CAPS6 didn't care even if my mom told him that @CAPS6 couldn't take it away. @CAPS6 wanted possession of it so @CAPS6 knew how my sister would feel. Not only did @CAPS6 take away her phone, but @CAPS6 took away her right to use toilet paper after using the bathroom. I don't know how long I laughed over that, but it felt like I was going to pee all over myself. As @LOCATION1 and I continued laughing @CAPS6 ran up the stairs as fast as @CAPS6 could rummaging through all the bathrooms in our house to get every last little square of toilet paper @CAPS3 was. Sad part was @CAPS6 even took off the shower head so that my sister wouldn't be able to use that also to clean herself. My mother got home and @CAPS3 was nothing to say. @CAPS6 was so embarrassed that we had heard that @CAPS6 had wiped his butt with his hand.

Were you with a group of @NUM1 friends at the time? Telling scary stories can be fun and games until someone gets too afraid and freaks everyone out. It starts out with everyone watching movies and having fun until the parents go up stairs and its time to party. It was called our \"\"@CAPS1 @CAPS2\"\" night, we call it \"\"@CAPS1 @CAPS2\"\" because, us @CAPS5 kids, we consider ourselves as @CAPS1. Our night involves @NUM2 antsy @LOCATION1, @NUM1 frightened teenagers, and a house that has said to be \"\"@CAPS6\"\".  To start this amazing night of terror, the guests had to arrive at first. Everyone reached at my house around @NUM4 pm. We started out by playing videos games, laughing, having a good time, eating, playing board games. Just your average teenage party. That was, until the parents went upstairs to go to bed. Once they were settled in bed and fast asleep, we brought out the \"\"@CAPS7 or @CAPS8\"\" games. I bet you thought we were gonna be immature seedlings and play the unrated version didn't you? Well, fortunately we are the @CAPS5 kids. Just your normal \"\"I @CAPS8 you to run around the house three times\"\" or \"\"@CAPS9 you ever kissed someone?\"\". Nothing unrated about that. After a while everyone just got bored of playing that redundant game, so we moved on to the next activity we were going to do which was to play sing-star on the @NUM5, but @LOCATION3 brought the wrong cords over so we couldn't hook the console up. Since that didn't turn out as planned, we started to chat and capture pictures of the @CAPS1. Since this was our \"\"@CAPS1 @CAPS2\"\", it was definitely necessary to take some pictures of all of us together as a @CAPS1. For our @CAPS1 role, it goes like this, I am the father, @PERSON3 is the mother, @LOCATION3 is the cat, @PERSON8 is the @CAPS12, @PERSON9, @PERSON5, @CAPS13 and @PERSON6 were my children, @PERSON1 is my brother, @PERSON7 is the strange atrocious woman, @PERSON4 is the sister in-law, and @LOCATION2 is our cable guy. This is how we all considered each other in the @CAPS1, so we all had to wear costumes that fit our personality traits for the photos. It took a while for everyone to concentrate and to stop bickering to each other, but we managed to cooperate and proceed with the photo shoot. After photos, it was time to fulfill our appetites. I ordered pizza ahead of time before my parents went to bed. We got @NUM6 different large pizzas. Hawaiian, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS19 @PERSON2, and @CAPS20. One by one, we all kept coming back for more. My \"\"daughter\"\" (@CAPS13) dropped her pizza onto the carpet and left a hulking red stain. We all started to pother. @PERSON9 got the cleaner, I got the rags, @PERSON4 got the @CAPS22, and @PERSON7 got the camera. She thought it would be humorous to take pictures while we scrubbed for our life. After the mess was cleaned up, we stopped eating and placed everything else away. Now it was @CAPS23 movie time. Snuggled up onto the couch with @NUM1 people all clutched together is the \"\"right\"\" way to contemplate a @CAPS23 movie. The movie we chose was called The @CAPS24. Every one sitting on top of every one was fun until someone had to use the bathroom. Then, that's when it all happened... when @PERSON4 got up to use the bathroom, the @CAPS25 turned off, all the lights in the house shut down and we kept noticing shadows whisking across our living room walls. @CAPS13 started to cry, @LOCATION2 was complaining, @PERSON4 wouldn't go to the bathroom, and I was freaking out. Since none of the lights would turn back on, we all got in a circle on the carpet and started telling legitimately scary stories. Most of them were genuinely honest, and the others were said to be myths. There was one story that @PERSON6 portrayed about a possessed @CAPS26 that had no left leg and would go around terrorizing pedestrians. Well, it just so happened that I had a @LOCATION1 that had no left leg and when we started telling that story my @LOCATION1 started to freak out and assail all of my guests. So I grabbed my dog whistle and commanded them to cease, and dismiss. After all of the commotion, my parents never woke up and we all scurried up to my room to continue our discussion of @CAPS23 stories. During the whole process of the @CAPS2, the main lesson was that you can conquer any kind of fear as long as you @CAPS9 a sense of laughter and friends to back you up with it and that's what happened at the party. We were just hysterical about the whole situation and nobody ever left someone alone by themselves and always comforted them with laughter. By far I would @CAPS9 to say that was my favorite and most adequately funniest parties I @CAPS9 ever had.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Essay: \" Laughter is an important element in a relationship. It shows the chemistry in a couple, and it shows happiness within family and friends. How depressing would it be if the world had no laughter? It would be like the \"\"@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4\"\". The joyous sound of laughter that bonds relationships allows you to get to know someone better and show them you have a warm heart. Ideally, when a person has a warm heart, your conscience tells you, you can trust them. The talent to laugh is a good element to have when you are meeting someone new, and spending time with your family. Last @DATE1, my youth group and I went on a missions trip to @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1. We would be reaching out to many new children as we held a @ORGANIZATION2 for a week in the small @CAPS5 town. We picked up the children from their houses and drove them to the @ORGANIZATION1 to play games and sing songs. As we met each child one by one, it was important to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we had come into their neighborhood with our straight serious faces in our big twelve passenger white vans, it would send out a different message to the children. Instead, we decorated our cars with crayola car paint markers and jumped out of the vans energetically with big bright smiles. We ran up to a house door, rung the doorbell, and asked the parents if their children wanted to come to our @ORGANIZATION2. We had to remember that these kids live in poverty and have gone through a lot. To share the gospel, it was important to show them that we were friendly so they could open up to us and let us tell them about @CAPS6. When we laughed with the children, their eyes would always smile and twinkle. A lot of the children just needed love and we did so by laughing with them and making jokes to one another.  Assuredly, our youth group made a change in the children lives. Our @ORGANIZATION2 is probably one of the biggest highlights of the year for them. In @ORGANIZATION1, the town's appearance is flat like a desert, there's no playgrounds, parks, or places they can go to and have fun. @CAPS8 gave us the power to share the gospel with these children and give them a fun @DATE1 to remember. @CAPS8 opened the hearts of the @CAPS5 children so that they @MONTH1 hear the word of @CAPS8. I honestly don't think we could have reached out to them if we had not been a friendly bunch. It just shows how important it is to laugh with one another, whether it be with strangers or your family. If there is no laughter within your family, something is wrong. It's a sign of broken relationships and a sense of closeness that is lost. In commercials, there's always advertisements where families are around the dinner table, or at a restaurant laughing together. Not everybody has to look like that picture perfect family everyday, but when a family laughs with one another, it shows the unity they have. Usually when people laugh, they do so because they understand the situation and have respect for one another. Of course a family does not have to be related, it could be your youth group, your friends, or anyone you feel close to and comfortable with. Your comfortable person could even be your future spouse. My cousin's story on how he met his wife is like the scene in a chick-flick movie. My cousin, @PERSON1, was working at a ski resort at the rental check-outs waxing skis, when a dark haired brunette comes toward him in her baggy snow pants and says, \"\"I can go down the biggest hill\"\" with the most flirtatious eyes and grin. Now, @PERSON1 was very confused as to why this girl would walk up to him and bluntly say that to him. But @PERSON1 was mesmerized with this gorgeous girl and all he could say was, \"\"@CAPS9\"\". The girl seemed thoroughly pleased with his answer and asked him when his next shift was. An hour later, @PERSON1 and this girl were having lunch together in the cafeteria. It turns out, this girl's name is \"\"@PERSON2\"\". Apparently, @PERSON2's friends spotted @PERSON1 first and told @PERSON2 the guy had a great laugh and he looked like a good person. They urged @PERSON2 to ask him out and get to know him. @PERSON2, being the daring one, agreed. @PERSON1's story proves the point that laughter is important. You don't know @CAPS2 @MONTH1 hear you and how that person could effect your future.  Laughter is an important element in your life. It brings out the joy in people's spirit, gives you opportunities to meet new people, and perhaps change their lives. It reflects @CAPS2 you are and changes the atmosphere around you. After all, we wouldn't want our world to be like \"\"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter\"\" would we?\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

The personal story about the youth group trip is engaging and relatable, illustrating the impact of laughter in a community setting. However, the organization of the essay could be improved, as the ideas are not always clearly connected, and the flow of the narrative is somewhat disjointed. The word choice is appropriate but could be more varied to create a stronger emotional impact. The sentence fluency is occasionally stilted, with long, complex sentences that could benefit from being broken down for better clarity.

The cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me. When I was about six my family decided to take a road trip along a @CAPS1 coastline. We were accompanied by another family with four kids. Put together there were @NUM1 kids for me to play with, but the closest one to my age was @PERSON1. He was only a couple years older than me. I adored @PERSON1. We explored, swam, giggled, and played tricks on our siblings together. Everything he did, I did.  We went to so many different beaches I can't remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a short and slender beach. On one side there was a cave. The cave was loaded with hermit crabs. Never in my life have I seen so many of them. There were mini hermit crabs, great big hermit crabs, and even bigger hermit crabs! It was as if our dreams had come true. @PERSON1 and I created sand castles, prisons, and water channels to keep the hermit crabs contained. Our older siblings weren't interested in them at all. That was alright though, in our eyes it only meant more for us!  When it was time to leave, @PERSON1 and I were devastated. We both knew that we wouldn't just come across another beach like this is the future. It finally hit us that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs. We stayed down on the beach near the cave for hours just saying our \"\"good byes\"\". When my mom eventually yelled across the beach saying that it was time to go, we both had made a quick decision. I had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before. I thought why not? @PERSON1 liked the idea, so we silently slid two hermit into our swim trunks. His crab in the pocket of his shorts, mine in my one piece swim suit. It sagged at the bottom, but I decided to ignore it and pretend like nothing was wrong. Guilt weighted down my scrawny little body, like I had stuck a ten pound rock in my suit, not a tiny little crab. My mom had asked me directly if I had left all the hermit crabs on the beach. I nodded, but my voice was absent.  Back on the road my sister and I played word games. Everything was fine, the music playing, my parents talking. and our wheels rolling down the narrow dirt road.Every once in a while I would have to move a little because I could feel my little hermit crab checking out his surroundings. We had been driving for about an hour when I let out a blood curdling scream. As my dad slammed on the brakes dust swirled around the car like a hurricane. I remember my mom swiveling in her seat to look at me and ask what was wrong. I didn't answer. As the pincers grabbed on again, I let out another urgent scream. I then decided it was time to quit hiding my little friend in the bottom of my swimsuit. Letting out the last prolonged scream I pointed down to my crotch. My sister's urgent hands pulled my swimsuit off and quickly found the little devil. I was so embarrassed and guilty that my mom just laughed. She said that I had already gotten my punishment for lying, and that she thought I had learned my lesson. I sure wasn't going to disagree on that. A few minutes later, our friends pulled over too. When we asked if everything was okay, they said while laughing, that one of the girls had gotten pinched by @PERSON1's hermit crab. That sent all of us laughing.  We never stopped laughing about that story. My family loves to humiliate me in front of friends, guys that I like, or adults that I don't even know. Every time my mother says that that crab grabbed right onto \"\"where it counts\"\" we all bust out laughing. And every time I turn tomato red in embarrassment, but I guess I deserve it.  @PERSON1 and I both learned our lessons, although I think I learned a few extra lessons. First of all, never put and animal near your \"\"sensitive\"\" parts. The second lesson was don't lie, because eventually you will most likely be be caught and punished. The last lesson would have to be to learn how to enjoy something when you have it and when it is time to let it go, let whatever it is let it go, and be grateful for the time you got to enjoy it. If I would have been able to just say good bye to my shelled friends, I would have never lied or felt so much pain. They were all great lessons to learn, and I am very grateful for them. Not only because I became a little wiser, but also because I have a great story to tell that always sends people up in laughter.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Essay: \" Have you ever wondered how you and your best friends even became friends? Maybe not, but maybe you have and couldn't remember. Well this story I'm about to tell you today is about how my friend @PERSON3 and I became friends. I'm also going to tell you how we have stayed friends for as long as we have and all the little things that have kept us friends. Admittedly we did not start off as friends who laughed all the time, instead we started off as a crier and a helper.  @PERSON3 and I first met in the eighth grade. I had just gotten called out of my first period class and greeted by my math teacher @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told me that we had just gotten a new student that moved here from @LOCATION1 and wasn't exactly happy about it. She also asked me if I wouldn't mind showing her around the school with another classmate, @PERSON4, I agreed and walked into the room @PERSON3 was in. When I saw her the first thing I noticed was her eyes, as the tears went down her face. Then I realized she was a very pretty girl who, like @PERSON1 said wasn't happy. I will admit i was a little scared to try and show her around seeing as she wasn't happy at all to be here. But once we got started she had calmed down immensely, but she still wouldn't even crack a smile at our feeble tempts to make jokes. I still felt like she should be happy and broke out the big guns. So I walked differently and talked in a funny voice, I even started saying random funny things in long pauses. Eventually she smiled, so I kept going. Toward the end I got her and @PERSON4 to laugh so hard we all almost wet ourselves. But as funny as it was for us, it definitely wasn't the last funny thing we did. You know the type of funny things that happen and no matter what, you always remember it when you see that person it happened with, right? Well to say the least @PERSON3 and I have a lot of those moments. Granted a lot of them happen with other people, but that's what makes it fun. Like this one time in our drawing and painting class we, @PERSON3, @LOCATION2, and @CAPS1 and I, were all in @PERSON2's little office getting a picture to draw. I had been hyper pretty much all day and so had @CAPS3 else. I randomly look around the room and see a really cute looking poster I hadn't noticed ever before and without realizing it I had said aloud, \"\"@CAPS2, that's really cute.\"\" @CAPS3 started laughing and holding on to the desk to keep from falling to the ground. I still hadn't realized I said it aloud and was really confused but still laughing because watching them laugh was really entertaining. They finally calmed down long enough to say what I'd just said and I blushed but started laughing along. Now every time they see me and remember that moment they crack up laughing and they point to something and say it the way I said it. That's why I think that having the big memories of the really funny thing has kept us together. It helps us remember the fun times during the bad times. It also helps to keep our link strong throughout the group of our friends.  But the little things matter too. Every little thing we do together as friends helps us later. If we didn't do all the little funny things and only did either big funny things, or boring things, I don't think our friendship would last long. Like when we're talking and we accidentally burp or we fart while we walk. Or maybe when I laugh and I hide my face with my hands and my arms jiggle. Possibly even when we say something weird or walk funny because we really have to go to the bathroom. It's not just being friends that keeps us together it's how we are and who we become with that other person, I feel like I become a better person and I believe I help her become one too. Besides the little things are just as funny as the big things we do.  So as I've stated before laughter is a big part of a friendship. @PERSON3 and my friendship hadn't started in of laughter, it started in tears and grew to be laughter. Laughter had brought us together in an act of weirdness and it has stayed very strong ever since, not only because we had a lot in common, to be frank we don't really even have that much in common, it is because of the big hilarious moments we've shared not only together, but with other people and the little things we do on a daily basis that we find really funny. I do have to say laughter is probably the best thing to keep any relationship good and healthy.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

Laughter is the element that could bring a group of people into a tight bond of friends. Laughter is the ultimate answer to success and happiness in life, and this is what the story of mine demanded me to say about laughter. Many times my family of four departs to go camping during the @DATE1. Family friends enjoy coming along with us on these vacations. A couple summers ago while on a camping trip with my family and lots of friends, I experienced and learned what true, rich laughter could do that changed my life. Whether I learned from the telling of funny stories at campfire, playing little practical jokes on each other, or just some old friendly card games of hearts, I really began to realize what the these times had meant to me. My best gal friend and I were expecting these three boys to join us all week. When the time came that they should arrive my friend and I started plotting out our secret plan. It was the boys duty before they could go out to the lake and start boating, to set up their tent. They managed to make a @NUM1 minute task take two hours, bravo to them. The three lost boys were at the water now as they had finally finished and could stand not to be anywhere but the lake any longer. While they were down swimming my friend and I took their hard worked tent and ripped out the stakes to collapse it first, only to then turn it inside out second. What better way to welcome new comers then to start off things with a good sense of humor.  The boys however didn't think it was quite so funny, however by @TIME1 fall they had a plan rising within them that my friend nor I knew was coming for us. Wake up call rolled around at about four in the @TIME2 for us two girls in a non-sound proof tent. We had a very loud wake up call that sounded as if the ducks were in a war zone against each other. We found out later, that the ducks found sandwiches mysteriously placed in a direct circle all around our tent. It was game on after the boys pulled that prank. It's hard for guys to get you back, if they're stuck in a tent. A zip tie would do the job. In the middle of the @TIME1, sneakily crawl over and zip tie their zippers together. Just as my friend and I thought this was the perfect way to get the boys back, one of our co-partners went and told the guys our plan. The three amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first. The next @TIME2 my friend and I woke, we tried to climb out of the tent and that was a little hard to do. Our zippers were tied together and that's not so great of mix when you have us girls that really need to use the restroom. One of the boys had a pocket knife with him and he was playing like cat and mouse with us, barely letting the knife out of our reach. When I finally had hold of the small blade, I ripped open the zippers, gently tossed the knife to the ground and ran to the ladies room. When I got back to blood on the ground, I found that it wasn't as gentle of a toss as I thought it was. The same guy that gave us the knife to use, put his foot in the way of the ever so slightly tossed knife. Once he was home his mom took him to the hospital to get stitches. Campfire that @TIME1 was a hoot. Cards together was hilarious too because by the end we knew how each person was going to play, pretty much we knew who would win and who would come in dead @TIME1. Even with someone having a cut open foot we were on the ground rolling around because we're laughing so hard. My gal friend and I took off the make up and jeans, put on a baggy sweatshirt and up do with our hair and really just had a great time that @TIME1. It was the @TIME1 together there on the camping trip and it was nice to know we were having a good time laughing, with just being our self's and expressing without trying to impress. Later as we're all talking about these stories and jokes pulled on each other, we came to recognize that these are the kinds of moments people live for. Laughing brought us closer together, we weren't friends before and now after our times shared we're exceptionally close best friends. Our friend relationship with each other was brought into contact by laughing in harmony together, by the @TIME1 spent together, by harmless little jokes played on each other, by turning a camping trip in to something much more meaningful.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

The content is interesting and reflective, but you could add more depth to your reflections on the significance of these experiences, linking them more explicitly to the overall theme of laughter. Your word choice is generally effective, though a few areas could be made more concise or vivid to better capture the reader\u2019s attention. The sentence fluency is slightly uneven; while some sentences flow well, others feel a bit too long or abrupt. Varying sentence lengths and structures will improve the overall rhythm.

It was freezing and dark outside. The walk home was to long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter. The cars kept passing and stairing, but all we could do was laugh some more because we knew we were making fools of ourselfs, we didnt care one bit. The weird voices that kept coming out our mouths, the crazy @CAPS1 dance moves and the facial exspressions were the funniest thing to us. Stupid things that people do are the funniest things. Becasue I knew if you laugh more then usual you will build your friendship more and live your life more to the fullest. As @PERSON2 and I were walking back home from @PERSON1 we were dreding the walk home. It seemed like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes away from my house, not even that. It also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be. Cars kept passing us but they weren't stairing at us yet. It was silent until something popped up in my brain. I had the best idea so the walk would be faster. I remebered this voice my god brother @CAPS2 that was like @CAPS3 compared to me even though he is younger would always do. It always put a smile on everyone and it was entertaining. This voice I wanted to try it, so I attempted to. We weren't even half way home until I started yelling radom words at cars, it was a dark scary voice and I sounded very controlling.  Then I had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice. That was a bad idea also, @PERSON2 started to dance and cars started to stare at us. @PERSON2 was this tall thin girl that was my bestfriend, she loved piercings and didn't care what others thought of her. I really didnt mind what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird. Watching @PERSON2 dance to my voice was the funniest thing I could ever see. I never thought something could get funnier then that, until she wanted to try the voice. When she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips I started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes we were almost to my house and it felt like our stomachs were going to bust open because of how long and hard we were laughing. While I was thinking to myself i thought\"\"@CAPS4, that seemed like two minutes just to get home.\"\"I knew that if @PERSON2 and I would just think of something to do until we got home then time would go faster. When we walked through the door of my house my mom asked us,\"\"@CAPS5 were you guys dancing while you were waling down the @NUM1 and I just looked at eachother and laughed and told her she doesn't even know how fun it was. Laughter is the only thing that brings two people closer I think. It doesn't matter if you make fools of yourself because you know whats fun. All that matters is that you and are build a relationship together. Doesn't matter if it's just friends trying to get to know eachother more or if it is a boyfriend/girlfriend just having fun and messing around. It's always good to have that laugh here and there and no that you have that connection with the other person and no your friendship is still there. \"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

The content, while enjoyable, could benefit from more depth and reflection; it focuses on a specific moment, but lacks further exploration into the emotions or insights that could have been drawn from the situation. The organization is somewhat disjointed, with certain transitions feeling abrupt or underdeveloped. Word choice is straightforward, yet it sometimes lacks the impact needed to fully convey the humor or sentiment intended. Sentence fluency is inconsistent, with some choppy or overly long sentences that disrupt the flow. Conventions are notably weak, with several spelling and grammatical errors, including incorrect use of \"there\" instead of \"their\" and missing punctuation marks, which detract from the overall readability. While the essay follows the prompt, it doesn\u2019t fully explore the deeper meanings of laughter or its effects on relationships, which could have strengthened the essay. The language is casual and conversational, fitting the tone of the story, but a more refined use of language could have made it even more engaging. The narrative is fun and captures the essence of youthful joy, but it could be more polished in terms of structure and clarity.

My mom said she had never seen such a fierce storm before in her life. It shook the house making it creak in odd places, like the floor boards. My @CAPS2 @PERSON1 sat at the kitchen table contemplating, worrying. They had rental houses acres off that were surrounded by trees, the ground was so soft ,so saturated by the rain and flooding that had taken over the valley. There were already hundreds of trees that had come uprooted there were bound to be more. The little homesteads that rested off of @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 including my papa's were well built weathered farm houses,most were surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres of land. You would be surprised to find someone out there with less then @NUM1 acres of land. It's wheat fields mostly, but you can easily find fields of corn, alfalfa, you'll find rows and rows of blueberries so big only @NUM2 can fit on the palm or your hand. It is literally paradise on earth, a small piece of heaven that was thrown down to earth by either accident or purposely. The sun is so bright and the sky is the clearest, most crisp blue. When weather rolls in giant fluffy clouds make the sky look like it's dappled with giant pieces of cotton. All this stretches over land so flat you wonder if it could possibly be real. I have spent so many wonderful , laughter filled summers there. Running bare foot through the fields, playing in the large expansion of lush, green grass. Feeding the goats, chickens, and pigs with my siblings. On @DATE1 my mom said she had never seen a place so beautiful turn so ugly in such a short period of time. My mom says if she had known what was going to happen that day she never would have let them get in that car. My papa, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 @PERSON2 pulled out of the driveway. Since it was a small car my @CAPS2 volunteered to ride in the back. The storm had been showing it's vicious temper for over two hours, and it showed no signs of letting up. They had set out to see what damage had been done on their acres of land, to see what needed fixing once this storm moved on over the mountains. There is no explanation, no one understood why my @CAPS3 walked away with not even a scratch on his body. No one knows how the tree fell or why it only landed on the back end of the car, but it did. Gods hand had swept down and caused destruction. My @CAPS2 was killed instantly, my papa was seriously injured but alive. He spent weeks in the hospital, during those weeks the news of the accident spread like wildfire as news does in a small town. Everyone loved my @CAPS2, she was social butterfly that fluttered from person to person , laughing, talking , sharing tears, and joy. She knew everybody, and everybody knew her. The heavens cried and howled that day, rain drops fell so heavily it felt as if the whole world was crying, crying just for you just to share your grief. It's painful, to lose someone so dear to your heart. My papa cried, he sobbed until he had no strength left to feel any emotion at all. he loved her so much, he needed her . Lightning struck the giant oak that stood tall and proud in my papa's backyard that day. It was the same tree that held my grandparents initials. The lightning split the top of the giant oak clean in two. Everyone saw it as a symbol, sign of how my papa and @CAPS2 had been struck apart quickly and forcefully. But, days before my papa returned home from the hospital, my dad climbed that giant oak and chained the severed part back together. With that my dad had made a symbol of his own, saying you will always be together just not physically, but you will never be truly apart. The day my papa returned home he saw the giant oak, and for the first time in weeks a glimmer of understanding shone in his eyes. A small amount of hope had settled over everything once again. Her funeral was a nice affair, elegant, simple, beautiful, just like her. The whole town came, they reminisced for hours, telling stories about my @CAPS2 and her crazy yet lovable nature. Then from across the room it came. Small at first then growing ever louder. Laughter. A smile, yes there were tears with that laughter, but it was laughter all the same I've never seen the saying \"\" laughter is the best medicine\"\" put to justice better. My @CAPS2 was one person who saw laughter, love, faith and hope as necessities in life. She brought joy to so many people, and now they were returning the favor.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

I met @PERSON1 when she moved from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. her dad was in the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS14 had been transferred to the base that was close to where I lived. We had two classes @CAPS14 lunch together. At first her @CAPS14 I didn't really talk much. It wasn't until one of my friends, @PERSON3, brought her to sit with us during lunch. Our friend @PERSON4 was overly hyper that day @CAPS14 ended up falling backwards in his chair @CAPS14 scaring some girls who'd been walking by at the time. We laughed so hard our faces went cherry red. After lunch we had class together, so we walked together @CAPS14 talked about lunch. I then asked her to sit with me during @CAPS3. We could not stop talking to save our lives. Luckily it was a free sketch day, for had it not have been we might have been in some trouble. After about a week had gone by @PERSON1 @CAPS14 I found out we had so much in common, it seemed almost unreal. Never had I met a girl who could make me laugh so hard that I actually enjoyed hanging out with every day. She'd make faces @CAPS14 tell me stories about her past that would make me just bust out laughing. We talk almost every other day threw the internet, @CAPS14 even though she's over @NUM1 miles away, she can still make my stomach hurt from all the laughing. As for @CAPS1, he grew up in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION5, then later on moved to @LOCATION4. We met while my dad, brother, @CAPS14 I went paint balling at a place called \"\"The @CAPS5\"\". It was a slow day. Not as many people were at the fields as normal, @CAPS6 some how there weren't enough tables. We offered to share ours with two guys whom I found out on were @CAPS7 friends, @CAPS8 @CAPS14 @CAPS9. As it got later in the day @CAPS1 @CAPS14 a few other friends, @PERSON5 @CAPS14 @PERSON2, arrived. The games got a bit more interesting, but still not one person had been able to shoot me out before the referee called time. I was starting to get irritated with the lack of experienced players, when finally I felt two sharp paint @CAPS14 heard a splat. I'd taken shots to the leg, mask, @CAPS14 trigger finger. When the game was over I spotted the guy who'd got me out. That person being @CAPS1. I ran over to him @CAPS14 said \"\"@CAPS12 @CAPS13\"\". He laughed @CAPS14 said \"\"that wasn't luck, I chose get you out\"\". I asked \"\"well then why haven't you got me out before? huh? You know that was so totally a @CAPS12 @CAPS13\"\". He returned with \"\"I was just going easy on you, I didn't wanna make you feel bad\"\". By then I had a smile on my face @CAPS14 a giggle in my voice \"\"sure, that's why\"\". We continued to joke about the game, @CAPS14 the people who were playing that day. When it was time for me to go he wrote his e-mail on a small torn piece of cardboard, @CAPS14 asked me to keep in touch. As soon as I got home I sent an e-mail saying \"\"I still think it was a @CAPS12 @CAPS13\"\". Ever since that day we've been best friends.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Essay: \"    Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory. It is also a key component to story telling, it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if your sharing a deep secret that no one else knows. Laughter is having something in common, it doesn't matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter. Inside jokes are laughter's best friend, from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them, they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone's face.   As a person, I feel that it is my duty to make people laugh. One example of this would be when I was seven years old and spending the night at my friend @PERSON1's house. We had just gotten done watching @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and were super hungry for lunch. As it turns out @PERSON1's big sister @PERSON2 was the only one home, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her \"\"baby sister\"\", so we were to fend for ourselves. Being young, we didn't want a boring old @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 sandwich, we wanted to make @NUM1 cupcakes! This might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven year old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems, or so we thought. In reality it was a disaster, we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands, which worked up until I brought the flower out. From now on I will never think of flower in the same manner, every time I open the jar of flower all I can think about is the mess @PERSON1 and I had made that day.   Lets just say it was a disaster, enough flower to successfully make @NUM1 cupcakes is approximately the whole bag. As I was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flower into the bowl, I slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup, and the flower went everywhere! @PERSON1 started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room. As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world. Now that I am a quite a bit older, I don't think I could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly, considering I would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up. But as a little girl, laughing was the only thing that mattered. @PERSON1 couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white. We started to play in the flower, picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti. When all of the sudden @PERSON2 came down the stairs, took one look at the kitchen and started to yell, \"\"@CAPS6 and clean this up! I was upstairs for and hour and you manage to make this big of a mess? Mom will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned\"\" @PERSON1 and I looked up at each other and back at the kitchen. Then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do. All of the sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if I had no care in the world.    It turns out that @PERSON1 and I completely ignored @PERSON2 and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes. We were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called \"\"snow\"\". I heard the slam of the front door as @PERSON1's mom walked into the house. It sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser. Because we didn't clean up anything, we in fact made the kitchen much worse, we made a split second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all. That @MONTH1 had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @ORGANIZATION1's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream, \"\"@PERSON1! What is this??\"\" . Slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and @PERSON1 starts explaining herself. I choose to stay quiet because I had never gotten in trouble by someone that wasn't my own mom before. When @PERSON1 is done telling her story, her mom tells us to go downstairs. Both of us are on the verge of crying, when all of the sudden @PERSON1 starts laughing once again. I could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says, \"\" you still have flower in your hair\"\".

The content is rich in detail, and the humorous nature of the experience is well conveyed. The reflection on how laughter helped ease the tension of the situation adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a recount of events. The organization is generally effective, but the essay could benefit from clearer transitions between some of the moments, as it occasionally feels like the story jumps from one point to the next. The sentence fluency is strong, with a good variety of sentence structures that help maintain the reader's interest. Word choice is generally strong, though at times, more precision in vocabulary could enhance clarity. Conventions are mostly followed, but there are a few punctuation and grammar errors that could be refined. Overall, the essay successfully captures the essence of laughter's role in relationships, but slight improvements in structure and conventions would elevate its impact even further."}]}

The more you laugh in life it makes it so much better and easier. Its better to laugh at something that's bad, like for example falling by someone or even making a simple mistake. It makes life not so difficult and more simple and easy. Laughing can make people happy and enjoy things better and possibly help them look forward to things in the future and help them conquer things that they wanna do in life. One thing that always make me laugh is my family and friends. They make everything easier for me by making me laugh. They don't always say the smartest or funniest thing in the world but it means a lot to me that they do it that. Especially when im not feeling upset or i just happened to not in a good mood, they say something that ll make me laugh and i usually feel a lot better knowing that they made me laugh to make me feel myself again. Most simple things make me laugh more and be happy. Like for example if someone says something totally stupid and know one else laugh's but me. But one thing that normally doesn't make me laugh is if someone got hurt pretty bad, like if they tripped. I wouldn't laugh at that because i wouldn't want someone to laugh at me if i fell and got hurt. I always hate when people brag about stuff that know else knows about that happened to them, like for example if they talk about they did over the @DATE1 and how \"\"high\"\" or \"\"drunk\"\" they got. Its really annoying to me and also very pointless because when they talk about it I never pay attention or just walk away because all that stuff annoys the heck out of me. Why would i wanna hear about how your ruining your life? Especially at a young age or even at all. Well that's my story and why i think the benefits or laughter is important.\"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.

I was choking on my words as I talk to my best friend @PERSON1. Every time we talked to each other some one would say something that we thought was funny and we would start laughing and laughing. When I look back on the things that we talked about most of what we said didn't make any sense at all and I don't know why we laughed so hard. One day at our bus stop @PERSON1 said something very funny and we laughed until the bus came. Than I said something funny and we laughed the whole bus ride to school. This happened almost every day for us. On this particular day we couldn't stop laughing not even when we got to our class room. Our @CAPS2 grade teacher had lots of pets in her class room and one of her pets was a tree frog named @CAPS1. That week was @PERSON1's and my week to take care of him. When we went to feed him @PERSON1 grabbed him and made him dance all over his cage. We both thought this was the most hilarious thing ever. Our eyes started watering and we were chocking on our words as we took our seats for class.  We laughed through the teacher giving instructions and while we were doing our class work. Eventually our teacher had to come up to us and tell us to be quite. This didn't stop us from laughing. We tried and tried to stay calm and do our work but we just couldn't stop. On this day lots of people in our class were chatty but no one was laughing as hard as @LOCATION1 and I were. We were so loud I thought the people in the class below us would hear us for sure.  It wasn't just us being loud it was the whole class. Our teacher stood in front of the class and yelled at us to be quite but that didn't stop us. In fact it made @LOCATION1 and I laugh even more. I thought I was going to pee my pants I was laughing so hard. Now @PERSON1 and I weren't the kind of girls who giggled quiet about things. We were the kind of girls who laughed really hard and loud with our eyes watering and our stomach muscles hurting us for the rest of the day. Our teacher wanted the whole class to be quite so she got in front of the class while we were doing our math problems. She told us to put down our pencils, push in our chairs and stand behind them, so we did. Then she told us to take a really big deep breath in, and we did. Next she told us to let out our breath as big as we cold. Lastly we were suppose to do that five times and then sit back down in our chairs and do our math problems silently with out talking to anyone. When @PERSON1 and I were taking our five deep breaths we did them very fast and very short to get them over with. We thought it was very funny and so did the rest of the class that saw us. The class started to laugh there heads off and the teacher didn't know what to do so she told us we would all have to stay in at recess if we didn't behave. Eventually the class settled back down and started doing there work quietly. Except for @PERSON1 and I. We kept laughing until the bell rang for school to be over.  We got on to the bus and started talking about how much fun we had that day and how funny it was when we were breathing really fast and not slowly like we were suppose to. Even to this day every time a teacher or someone tells us to take deep breaths for something @PERSON1 and I look at each and start laughing, and than we breath really fast. Now we are sophomores in high school and we still have times where we laugh uncontrollably for no reason at all. I think its just a part of being best friends with someone. Some times we even laugh all day long like our day in the @CAPS2 grade. Through out our friendship we have learned to be much quieter when we do our breathing and when we laugh during a class or something important. I believe that @PERSON1 and I will always be best friends and we will always have our laughing moments together weather it's in a class, on the bus, while we are driving, at college, or on the phone. Laughing is something that everyone needs to experience in there life time. Not a giggle or a small laugh out loud but a really hardy laugh were you can't control yourself, your eyes are watering and your stomach hurts to bad to move just like @PERSON1 and I did in @CAPS2 grade. \"\nEssay Prompt: We all understand the benefits of laughter.
