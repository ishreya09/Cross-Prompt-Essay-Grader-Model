The content covers the obstacles faced during the Empire State Building's construction, yet it could be more comprehensive, especially regarding the specific challenges and potential solutions. The organization is clear but lacks depth, as the narrative progression could be more detailed and structured. Word choice is somewhat repetitive and could benefit from more precise terms, particularly when explaining the technical aspects of the construction. Sentence fluency is adequate, though the essay would benefit from more varied structures and smoother transitions between ideas. Conventions are mostly correct, but there are some minor issues with punctuation. The essay adheres closely to the prompt, but it could be more detailed in its description of the challenges. Language is appropriate for the topic, but it lacks the expressive depth that could make the essay more engaging.
