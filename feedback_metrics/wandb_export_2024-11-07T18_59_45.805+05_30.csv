","This essay argues against the use of computers, though the points made are difficult to follow due to the overall lack of clarity and coherence. The content feels disjointed and repetitive, with some ideas not fully explained. The organization is weak, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion, which makes the argument hard to follow. Word choice is very basic, and there are frequent issues with spelling and grammatical errors, which affect the readability of the essay. Sentence fluency is particularly problematic, as many sentences are incomplete or poorly structured, making it hard for the reader to engage with the argument. The conventions are not consistently followed, with numerous spelling mistakes and punctuation errors. Overall, the essay fails to make a convincing case due to its lack of depth, organization, and clarity. For improvement, the writer should work on clarity, structure, and coherence, and avoid overly simplistic language"

","This essay demonstrates a basic understanding of how computers can positively affect people. The writer touches on several relevant points, such as staying connected with family and friends, applying for jobs, and using a laptop for homework and shopping. However, the content could benefit from more depth and specificity to strengthen the argument. Adding concrete examples or elaborating on the benefits would enhance the clarity and impact of the message. The structure of the essay lacks clear transitions, making the ideas seem disjointed. To improve organization, consider grouping similar points together and using transition words to connect them smoothly. The word choice in this essay is very basic and occasionally unclear, such as ""exciseses"" instead of ""exercises"" and ""postitive"" instead of ""positive."" Focus on using more precise vocabulary to improve the clarity and professionalism of the writing. The sentence fluency also suffers from a lack of variety and some awkward phrasing, which can make the essay feel choppy. Experiment with different sentence structures to improve the flow and engagement of the essay. There are several grammatical errors, such as missing articles (""a"" before ""laptop"") and inconsistent capitalization, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. To improve, make sure to review grammar and punctuation rules to maintain consistency throughout the essay. Finally, the essay does not fully address the prompt as effectively as it could. The writer could elaborate on how computers have an impact on society beyond the individual, offering a more well-rounded perspective."

"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard about your problems with computers, and would like to state my opinion. I think that computers teach you more than they, disable you. For example , say you have a research project and you need to look someone up, you go on the computer and you got him. Also, say you want to go far for vacation; like @LOCATION1. You can go on the internet and find out how they live there. My last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends. First, I stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago I had a social studies research project. But ig I couldn't use a computer then I would of had to use a book; instead of going on the computer and just looking it up. Another exsample could be like you need pictures to make the project look better . So you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project. But thats not all the internet can help you with. Like say you been planning a trip to @LOCATION1 for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it, but your honeymoon is a month away. You can go on the computer and learn about it. Also now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go. But to wrap it up I have on more exsample. Lastly, chatting sosme people think because you on the computer all day you can't interact with others, but you can. for exsample, like they have a website called @ORGANIZATION1. You can chat with all your friends at once. Also they have video chatting, so you can be looking right at the person while your talking, all that's all I can think of.

","This essay argues that computers offer numerous benefits, particularly in terms of research, travel planning, and staying connected with family and friends. The content is generally relevant, with practical examples like using the internet for research and learning about different locations for vacation. However, the essay could benefit from more development of these points to make the argument more compelling. The organization is clear, though transitions between ideas could be smoother. Word choice is simple and appropriate, but at times it lacks variety, which could enhance the essay's effectiveness. Sentence fluency is fairly consistent but could be improved by varying sentence structures to avoid repetitiveness. Conventions are generally followed, but there are several spelling and grammatical errors that need to be addressed to improve the professionalism of the writing. While the essay remains relevant to the prompt and offers personal insights, better development of ideas, improved organization, and attention to conventions would strengthen the overall quality of the argument."

Essay Prompt: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people.

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Write a letter to your local newspaper in which you state your opinion on the effects computers have on people. Persuade the readers to agree with you.

","The essay argues in favor of computers benefiting society, highlighting their utility in learning and making life easier. However, the content lacks sufficient detail to fully support the claims, and the points made are not developed thoroughly. The organization is functional, with a clear structure, but the essay's ideas feel repetitive, and the connections between them are weak. Word choice is simplistic, and many sentences lack the precision needed to make a stronger impact. Sentence fluency is hindered by awkward phrasing and repetitive structure, leading to a stilted flow. Conventions are poorly followed, with frequent spelling and punctuation mistakes, such as ""threw"" instead of ""through"" and ""beacuse"" instead of ""because."" The essay adheres to the prompt but lacks depth and critical analysis of the topic. Language is overly simplistic and could benefit from more sophisticated expression to engage the reader. While the essay conveys a clear stance, it would be much more effective with clearer arguments, better organization, and stronger language conventions."

","This essay attempts to argue that managing time spent on computers through scheduling, encouragement, and activities can have positive effects. However, the argument lacks depth and detail, which makes it hard to follow. The content is very basic, and there is little explanation or evidence to support the claims made. For instance, the section on scheduling and spending time outside is mentioned briefly, but it does not explain why this would be effective or how it relates to computer usage. The essay's structure is also disorganized, with abrupt transitions between points, and the sentence fluency is choppy. The use of vague phrases such as ""Encouragement helps a lot of people"" does not contribute much to the overall argument. In terms of language, there are frequent errors, including punctuation and grammatical mistakes like ""scheduleing"" instead of ""scheduling"" and awkward phrasing. To improve, the essay needs clearer organization, more specific examples, and better sentence construction."

","The essay argues that computers are beneficial to society, focusing on their role in providing information, enabling communication, and increasing convenience. The writer gives good examples of how computers can be used to find information, communicate with others, and facilitate remote work. However, the essay lacks depth in discussing these points, and the argument is somewhat repetitive. Some sections, such as the comparison to books and the reference to the writer's uncle, could be expanded for more impact. The essay is mostly well-organized, but there are some issues with word choice and sentence structure. Minor grammar errors and missing words detract from the overall fluency of the writing.

","This essay argues that computers benefit society, highlighting their role in education, social interaction, and providing knowledge. While the content addresses the prompt, it lacks detailed explanations and specific examples to support the claims. The organization of the essay is weak, as ideas are not clearly connected, and transitions between sentences are abrupt. Word choice is limited, and there are several awkward phrases that reduce the clarity of the essay. Sentence fluency is also an issue, with some sentences being overly simplistic or incomplete. Conventions are not well followed, as the essay contains numerous spelling errors and inconsistent punctuation. Overall, while the essay touches on important points, it needs significant improvements in clarity, organization, and language. To strengthen the essay, the writer should expand on their ideas with more examples, improve sentence structure, and address grammatical issues."

Essay Prompt: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Write a letter to your local newspaper in which you state your opinion on the effects computers have on people. Persuade the readers to agree with you.

","The essay addresses the concerns surrounding excessive computer use, focusing on its impact on health and social behavior. The content, however, lacks clarity in some sections, and the arguments are not fully developed, which weakens the overall message. The organization of ideas is weak, as there are abrupt shifts between topics without clear connections, leading to confusion. Word choice is often vague or incorrect, which impedes the clarity of the points being made. Sentence fluency is also an issue, as many sentences are fragmented or lack proper structure, affecting the essay’s overall readability. Conventions are poorly followed, with numerous spelling and grammar mistakes that detract from the essay’s professionalism. The essay does not adhere closely to the prompt, as it veers off into disjointed thoughts rather than focusing on the benefits and drawbacks of computers. To improve, the essay would need a clearer structure, better argument development, and a significant revision of grammar and word choice. The overall impact is minimal, and a more focused approach would enhance its effectiveness"

","This essay argues for the removal of offensive materials from public libraries, emphasizing that parents do not want their children exposed to inappropriate content. The author asserts that libraries should be safe spaces for learning, where individuals do not have to worry about encountering offensive materials. They express concern that young, impressionable minds might come across crude text or mature themes that they are not ready to understand, which could lead to confusion or unwanted discussions about sensitive topics. The essay suggests that if children access adult materials, it may result in them using inappropriate language or asking questions about subjects their parents are not prepared to address. The author contends that while parents have the right to monitor what their children read, libraries should also take responsibility for the content they make available. However, the argument lacks depth and specificity; while the author raises valid concerns about exposure to inappropriate content, they do not provide concrete examples or evidence of the negative consequences of such exposure. Additionally, the organization of the essay is somewhat disjointed, making it difficult for readers to follow the progression of ideas. The writing contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as ""rumaging"" instead of "" rummaging"" and ""expossed"" instead of ""exposed,"" which detract from its professionalism. To improve this essay, the author should focus on providing specific examples to support their claims and enhancing overall coherence and clarity. By refining word choice and correcting grammatical errors, the essay can more effectively communicate its message about the importance of protecting young readers from potentially harmful materials in libraries"

If you show a man a piece of women's clothing on a computer screen, he will probably only have one or two opinions about that piece of clothing. If you show a woman that same piece of clothing, she will have more than two opinions about the piece of clothing. This is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way; this is how we think and how we act.     @ORGANIZATION1 depicts beautiful as half dressed and makup put on like plaster. Many magazines and books, such as @CAPS1 and books about modeling, portray beautiful as stick thin and your clothes almost falling off your body. Many songs and movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside. If you can find these magazines, books, and movies at your local bookstore, don't you think that they could possibly be two miles down the road at your local @CAPS2 library?      Libraries aren't just for adults and teenagers. They are intended for people of all ages. Many people do not realize this, but at many libraries, there are sections specified for teenagers. Young adult books and magazines should not even be put in the teenager section, only for the reason that there are subjects in many of the young adult books that a lot of teenagers have not even begun to dicuss yet. If these books and magazines are put in here for teenagers, do you not think a five year old child could wander up to the section, take out a magazine and wonder how the women in the advertisements grew up to be so beautiful? Like I said before, @ORGANIZATION1 depicts people to look beautiful, when it's all photo-shopped.      If a five year old child can get their hands on books and magazines that they shouldn't even know about, @CAPS3 would a library keep them on their shelves. The thoughts that the five year old child has now is '@CAPS3 am I not that beautiful?' @CAPS4 image is the key to how people view society today. Modeling agencies, photographers, and even cheerleading coaches make girls feel like they are worthless because they are 'too fat', 'too ugly', or 'too short' to be part of what they have wanted to be in their entire lives. Many women that @CAPS8 starve themselves every day just to maintain the 'healthy weight' which is @NUM1 pounds and you can see every rib in her body.      Many books, magazines, and television shows portray this as well. You can find them in libraries nation-wide. The magazine, @CAPS1, has articles about how to become skinny. The television show, @LOCATION1's @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, shows people that being tall and as skinny as a stick is the way to go. Many workout books tell you that being like @PERSON1 is the 'best for your bod' way to be. You cannot tell a girl that she needs to be a specific height and a specific weight by a specific time. Woman don't work that way. No one does.      Many magazines, books, movies, and music tell you this, and it is not true. I believe that if libraries took these types of materials out of their facilities, then if would drop the rate of society's '@CAPS4 image' rapidly. Many woman and girls wouldn't feel like they are ugly or fat. They would love who they were and they would not believe what another person says about them or what they look like. Being beautiful is not just on the outside. Anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else.""

","This essay discusses the impact of societal standards of beauty as portrayed in media, arguing against the removal of certain materials from libraries that contribute to these standards. The author asserts that there are diverse opinions on topics like beauty, particularly how women are depicted in magazines, books, and movies, and emphasizes that individuals should not be judged solely based on their appearance. The essay effectively highlights the negative influence of media on self-image, particularly for young girls, by pointing out how unrealistic portrayals can lead to feelings of inadequacy. However, the argument lacks depth in certain areas; for example, while the author mentions the portrayal of beauty in various media forms, specific examples could strengthen the argument further. The organization is somewhat disjointed, making it difficult for readers to follow the progression of ideas. Additionally, the essay contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as ""dosn't"" instead of ""doesn't"" and ""dicuss"" instead of ""discuss,"" which detract from its professionalism. Sentence fluency is inconsistent, with several run-on sentences that complicate readability. To improve this essay, the author should focus on providing clearer examples and evidence to support their claims while enhancing organization and coherence. By refining word choice and correcting grammatical errors, the essay can better convey its message about the importance of diverse representations in media and their effects on societal perceptions of beauty."

I dont think they should because the parents arent going to let them get it or watch the movie if they dont think it is something they need to be watching. The kids know what they can and cant watch so if it is something they know they cant watch then they shouldnt get it. The kids might get it but the parents could take it away and tell them they cant watch it.      Should all books.magazines, music, or movies from libraries be censered? No. If it is a library at school everything has to be school approprit. If the book, movie, magazine, or music is not approprit they the school cant lone it out. A public library can but there are mostly adults there. The kids should know what they can and cant watch, read, or listen to, so they should know better than to get something they cant read, watch, listen to, or look at.

","This essay addresses the topic of censorship in libraries, particularly regarding books, magazines, and movies. The author argues against the censorship of materials, suggesting that individuals should have the freedom to choose what they read or watch, regardless of content. The essay emphasizes that while some parents may restrict their children's access to certain materials, ultimately, it is up to the individual and their guardians to decide what is appropriate. The author also asserts that children are capable of understanding boundaries regarding what they can or cannot consume.
While the essay presents a clear opinion on the issue, it suffers from several weaknesses. There are numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, such as ""aproprit"" instead of ""appropriate"" and ""censored"" instead of ""censored."" These issues detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing. Additionally, the organization could be improved; although there are distinct points made throughout the essay, they could be structured more cohesively to enhance flow and coherence. For instance, transitioning between ideas more smoothly would help guide the reader through the argument.
To improve this essay, the author should focus on refining language and grammar for clarity and correctness while enhancing organizational structure to create a more logical progression of ideas. By addressing these areas for improvement, the essay can more effectively communicate its stance on censorship in libraries and engage readers with a well-supported argument."
"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""Certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, and comics can be offensive to certain people.

","This essay addresses the contentious issue of censorship in relation to various forms of media, including books, movies, and comics. It begins by acknowledging that materials can be perceived as offensive by different individuals, which is a valid point that highlights the subjective nature of offense. The argument is supported by the assertion that with approximately 8 billion people in the world, each person has a unique perspective, suggesting that banning certain materials could hinder personal growth and learning. However, while the essay raises important considerations about the implications of censorship, it struggles with organization and clarity. The flow of ideas is somewhat disjointed, making it difficult for readers to follow the central argument effectively. There are several instances of vague phrasing and repetition, such as the overuse of ""@MONTH1"" and ""@NUM1,"" which detracts from the overall impact of the writing. Word choice is often imprecise; for example, phrases like ""taking away a person's ability to learn"" could be articulated more powerfully to resonate with readers. Sentence fluency is inconsistent, with some sentences feeling overly long or convoluted. This affects the overall readability of the essay. Additionally, adherence to conventions is lacking; grammatical errors and awkward phrasing appear throughout, which can distract from the message being conveyed. To enhance this essay, it would be beneficial to focus on improving organization by clearly delineating main points and supporting arguments in separate paragraphs. Incorporating specific examples or anecdotes could also strengthen the argument and provide a more engaging narrative. Lastly, refining word choice for clarity and impact will elevate the overall quality of the writing. By addressing these areas for improvement, the essay can more effectively communicate its message about the dangers of censorship and its potential effects on creativity and expression."

","This essay presents a clear viewpoint in favor of retaining books and media in libraries, even if some may find them offensive, with an argument rooted in public access and the educational needs of students. The content is well-reasoned, offering a practical example about human trafficking research, which provides depth and relevance. The organization is fair, with a logical progression of ideas, although adding smoother transitions would make the essay more cohesive. The vocabulary is somewhat basic, and elevating the word choice could enhance the argument's persuasiveness. Sentence fluency is good, with a reasonable variety of structures, though there is room to refine phrasing for greater clarity. Grammar and spelling need attention; misspellings like ""becuase"" and ""fuct"" detract from the essay’s credibility. Prompt adherence is strong, as the essay stays focused on the need to maintain access to diverse materials. Language expressiveness is moderate, but adding a more formal tone would align better with the persuasive nature of the argument. Overall, with a few enhancements in vocabulary, grammar, and organization, this essay could effectively present a balanced argument for media accessibility."

I believe that there should be a very limited selection that children can see. Things that are inappopreite should not be visable to children. I think that things that are bad should be removed from the selves and placed some where else. Also the music on the radio is censored yes but it doesn't mean that people don't know what the words are. There are people that get affended by certain words and they are still on the radio, on @CAPS2, in books. They are everywhere. Things would be completely different if people would watch what they put in stuff. It makes people expecly children believe that certain things are @CAPS1 and they are not. We should have very strict rules on things like that so then nothing inapporpreite is shown to people making them believe it is all @CAPS1. There are rules now on things like that but it doesn't mean that underage children are still getting to see this kind of stuff. That's why I believe there is so much violence now because children are plating video games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 and when they see shooting and stuff they think it's @CAPS1 and they grow up believing that.

","This essay addresses the topic of censorship in relation to books, movies, and music, arguing for stricter controls on what children are allowed to access. While the essay raises important concerns about the influence of inappropriate content on young audiences, it suffers from several significant issues. The content is underdeveloped, with vague assertions that lack supporting examples or evidence; for instance, elaborating on how specific types of media can negatively impact children's perceptions would strengthen your argument. The organization is somewhat disjointed, as ideas are presented without clear transitions, making it challenging for readers to follow your line of reasoning. Word choice is often imprecise and informal, with numerous spelling errors (e.g., ""cenorship,"" ""childern,"" ""inappopreite"") that detract from the professionalism of the essay. Sentence fluency is hampered by repetitive structures and awkward phrasing, which can disengage readers. Additionally, adherence to conventions is poor, with frequent grammatical mistakes that need correction for clarity and readability. Overall, while the essay highlights valid concerns regarding censorship and its implications for children, it requires substantial improvement in content depth, organization, word choice, sentence fluency, and grammatical accuracy to effectively convey its message."
"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""Yes, I believe that certian materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some people do not want to read about those things that they have less intrest in. Materials like that can offend many people, so they should be removed from public shelves.      For example, someone, by accident, @MONTH1 stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials. They could take it home and begin reading it, and realize that the material that they are reading contains information that offends them. That really concerns some people and can hurt the library that held the book, and they could begin losing customers.      Another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is, children. What if a young child was wondering around a store or a library, and randomly picked up a book or magazine with offensive pictures in it? That young child would see things that were not meant for that child to see. But, it does happen. Imagine how angry the parents of the child would be. They would most likely do everthing they could to get those materials removed from being displayed in public and from being within a child's reach. Children deffinately do not need to be seeing those things and also, even some adults do not even prefer it.      Religion is also an example of why places should watch what they put on their shelves. It @MONTH1 be against some religions to read inappropriate materials. And with out them knowing their book contained it and they read it, they would be greatly offended and very upset. That could turn many people away from reading certain books, or even going to the store where they even purchased those materials.      In conclusion, all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate materials should be removed to prevent people from being offended. This is why materials such as books, magazines, etc. should be removed from public shelves, because they can offend many people""

","This essay argues for the removal of offensive materials from public shelves, emphasizing the potential for harm and discomfort caused to both adults and children. The content is relevant and provides several scenarios to support the argument, such as concerns for young children and religious sensitivities. Organization is logical, with points introduced in a sequential manner that aids in building the argument, though some points feel underdeveloped. Word choice is basic and repetitive, with terms like “offensive” used frequently without much variation. Sentence fluency is somewhat smooth but could benefit from transitions and restructuring for better flow. Conventions are weak, with frequent spelling errors (e.g., ""certian"" instead of ""certain,"" ""deffinately"" instead of ""definitely"") and grammatical issues, which detract from the essay’s professionalism and clarity. Overall, the essay provides a clear stance and examples but could be strengthened with refined language, sentence transitions, and careful proofreading."
"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""Hello I am kristin, I am here to tell you why we should take some magazines out of our public libraries. Now I dont know if you have heard about @CAPS1 the magazine or @CAPS2 magazine. But I have and I also use to read them. In some of thouse issues are sex tips.           Now if I was a mother and my child ran up to me beging me to let them cheek that thing out I would look at them and say no. They dont need to undestand sex untill they are in there teens or atleast thirteen or fourteen. A child shouldnt be able to even go near that area they should only be able to go near the children's section.           Some parents think like me and agree with the fact that a child shouldn't learn about sex. But others are like why not they are going to know about it in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and when they are married also.           There are also some other things that need out of a librarie. Some music might not be the best choice for a young child. Like for example rap music. It has allot of cussing in it and talking about sex. Some of the things said in a rap song are shorty let me rind you like a huricain. Thats just like saying hey chick lets do it for the heck of it. Thats not what I want my kid to listen to. I want my child to listen to stuff that says hey lets go outside and camp or duck duck gusse.              Some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as its not over @NUM1. But if it is they can't watch it. I'll give you another example my little neice is probubly around the age of ten or so. She watche's @CAPS5 @CAPS6 but only with her parents inthe same room as her. She can not watch it by herself or she will get grounded.      This is why some of the stuff should be taken out of our public Libraries""

","This essay presents a stance in favor of removing certain magazines, music, and movies from libraries due to their inappropriate content for children. It touches on specific types of materials, such as magazines with sexual content and rap music with explicit lyrics, to support its argument. The content reflects the prompt by addressing various media in libraries, though the essay could be strengthened by further development of its points and clearer examples. Organization is present but could benefit from a more cohesive structure, as ideas sometimes appear disjointed. Vocabulary and word choice are basic, with repetitive phrases that limit engagement; more varied language would add depth. Sentence fluency is inconsistent, with several awkward phrases that interrupt the flow, such as “some of the things said in a rap song.” Conventions are handled inconsistently, with spelling errors (""allot"" for ""a lot"" and ""librarie"" for ""library"") and some grammatical mistakes. While the essay provides a relevant response to the prompt, it would benefit from additional clarity, smoother transitions, and improved sentence structure to strengthen its argument and readability."

","This essay argues against censorship based on personal preferences, suggesting that everyone has the right to access material according to their own views. However, the content is poorly developed, and the argument lacks clarity and cohesion. The essay includes numerous spelling errors (""belive"" for ""believe,"" ""appioin"" for ""opinion,"" ""appropreate"" for ""appropriate""), awkward phrasing, and several instances of nonstandard grammar, such as ""@CAPS1"" and ""@CAPS6't,"" which make the meaning difficult to decipher.

","This essay is a brief letter to the editor arguing against the removal of movies, books, and music from shelves, suggesting that such actions could lead to conflict and legal issues. The author expresses concern about potential backlash from the community when materials are censored, citing examples of public outrage and violence as consequences of removing content. While the essay raises important points about the implications of censorship, it suffers from several weaknesses. The argument lacks depth and specificity; while the author mentions public reactions, there are no concrete examples or evidence to support these claims. The organization is somewhat effective, but it could benefit from clearer transitions between points. Additionally, the vocabulary used is often informal and imprecise, with spelling errors like ""realy"" instead of ""really"" and ""suw"" instead of ""sue,"" which detract from the professionalism of the writing. Sentence fluency is inconsistent due to several run-on sentences that affect readability. Furthermore, numerous grammatical errors undermine the essay's credibility. To improve this piece, the author should develop their arguments with specific examples, refine word choice for precision, and correct grammatical mistakes to enhance overall clarity and impact. By addressing these areas for improvement, the essay can more effectively communicate its message about the importance of preserving access to diverse media while considering the potential consequences of censorship."

","This essay argues against the removal of certain books, music, movies, and magazines from shelves, asserting that doing so would deprive people of valuable reading and viewing experiences. The author expresses a belief that current media, such as rap music and various movies, is popular and enjoyable, even if some may consider it ""bad."" However, the essay suffers from numerous critical weaknesses that significantly hinder its effectiveness. The content lacks clarity and depth; while the author makes valid points about the popularity of contemporary media, the arguments are vague and not well-supported by specific examples. The organization is poor, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes it difficult for readers to follow the main argument. Additionally, word choice is often imprecise and informal, with multiple spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""maganzines"" instead of ""magazines"" and ""buissness"" instead of ""business,"" which detract from the professionalism of the writing. Sentence fluency is inconsistent, with many run-on sentences that lead to confusion about the author's main points.

"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""Offensive literature, sexual content, disagreeable topics. Books all have those things to someone some where. It would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left. There are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong. Censorship only causes curiosity. Censoring books could take away from learning. The real world is not censored so books should not be either.     Consorship only causes curiosity. Young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do. Many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do. Being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth. No one likes to be told what they can and can not do. The same goes for being told what you can and can not read. No one wants the truth cut out of  their reading materials.      Censoring books could take away from learning. In school children are required to read many different books in their english classes. Some books, depending on the teacher, have what some would consider offensive language and topics. What some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life. Reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life. In fact, the real life situation would seem to be more offensive. If we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist.     The real world is not censored so books should not be either. You can not go walking down the street and expect a loud beep to randomly play over someone's foul banter everytime they curse. When someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely. We can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material. Has no one ever heard of freedom of speech? That ammendment was created for a reason, to let @CAPS1 speek their beliefs.     Everywhere we look today things are being censored and 'cleaned up' to make others happy who @MONTH1 be offended by whatever it is they are censoring. Sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about. People need to be able to speek their minds and beliefs. But people also need to be able to have constructive critisism and be mature about offensive writing. Everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read. It is just life""

","This essay presents a well-structured argument against censorship, emphasizing how exposure to diverse perspectives in books is essential for learning and understanding the real world. The essay addresses multiple aspects of the prompt, including the counterproductive nature of censorship, its impact on learning, and the idea that real-life interactions aren't censored. The content is thoughtful, though it could be strengthened by incorporating concrete examples or referencing specific literary works that are often censored to give the argument more depth. Organization is clear, with each paragraph focusing on a distinct point, which aids readability. The vocabulary is varied and generally appropriate for the topic, though some minor grammatical errors and misspellings, such as ""consorship"" for ""censorship"" and ""speek"" for ""speak,"" detract from overall polish.

If the material was so offensive that it went against the law, then it probably wouldn't have been published in the first place.

But people need to learn to understand that other people think differently and have different values.  Though peoples' opinions differ, each opinion is equally important to that certain person.     So many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions.  As a student I often have a hard time finding meaningful literature in the school library because it is so censored.  I am not complaining about this because I understand that schools have to be careful of what they are exposing students to.  But if I am looking for something maybe more religious, derogoratory, or less accepted, it is nice to have a public library where I can find these things.       In closing, if people are offended by something on the shelves of a library then they shouldn't read, watch, or listen to it.

To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land.

Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.''

","This essay excels in detailing how the setting affects the cyclist.

The essay also highlights how the cyclist’s attitude changes after receiving water. The writing is clear, with good attention to both the physical and emotional impact of the setting.

","This essay does a good job of analyzing how the setting affects the cyclist physically and emotionally. The isolation in the desert and the scarcity of resources are highlighted effectively, particularly the way the cyclist’s despair shifts to hope at the thought of the cool pines and rivers. However, the analysis could delve deeper into how the setting affects the cyclist’s mindset, showing more internal conflict or resolution as the journey continues. The language is clear, and the structure is coherent, though there is some room for improvement in providing more detailed examples from the text. The narrative aspect is well-executed, showing the emotional journey the cyclist undergoes."

","This essay discusses the various features of the setting in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and their effects on the cyclist's experience. The author begins by noting the initial conditions, where the cyclist is relatively unaffected by the heat due to a sufficient water supply. However, as the journey progresses through the high deserts of California in June, the rising temperatures and dwindling water supply begin to take a toll on him, leading to fatigue and dehydration. The narrative highlights how changing terrain, specifically the transition from flat roads to rolling hills and rough dirt paths, further exacerbates his exhaustion as he must exert more energy to navigate these challenges. By the end of the ride, the combination of harsh weather conditions and difficult terrain leaves the cyclist exhausted and dehydrated. The essay effectively captures how environmental factors influence the cyclist's physical state and overall experience, providing a clear understanding of the challenges faced during this journey.

","This essay attempts to discuss the impact of the desert setting on the cyclist, but it suffers from significant issues that hinder its effectiveness. The author begins by noting the dangers of heatstroke due to dehydration, which is a relevant point. However, the writing contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as ""where the cyclist is at"" instead of ""where the cyclist is,"" ""dehygrated"" instead of ""dehydrated,"" and ""lijdid"" instead of ""liquid."" These mistakes detract from the clarity and professionalism of the essay. Additionally, the organization is weak; ideas are presented in a fragmented manner that does not create a cohesive narrative. While the mention of wind providing some cooling relief is a positive point, it lacks depth and does not fully explore how these environmental factors affect the cyclist's physical and emotional state. To improve this essay, the author should focus on correcting grammatical errors, enhancing sentence structure, and providing more detailed descriptions and analysis of how these environmental factors influence the cyclist's experience. By addressing these areas for improvement, the essay can more effectively convey the profound effects of the desert setting on the cyclist's journey."

","The essay discusses the challenges faced by a cyclist in the California desert, emphasizing how the setting contributes to dehydration and potential danger. The author notes that the cyclist initially has enough water for the journey if he follows the mapped route. However, he is influenced by old men who suggest a shortcut, which ultimately leads him into a perilous situation where he risks heat stroke and dehydration. The narrative highlights that had the cyclist adhered to the map, he could have stopped for water at a store, suggesting that the setting's harsh conditions could have been mitigated with better planning. Despite addressing important themes related to decision-making and environmental challenges, the essay suffers from several weaknesses. It contains numerous grammatical errors, such as ""makeing"" instead of ""making,"" ""thot"" instead of ""thought,"" and ""scorging"" instead of ""scorching,"" which detract from its clarity and professionalism. Additionally, the organization is somewhat disjointed, with ideas presented in a simplistic manner that does not form a cohesive narrative. To enhance this essay, the author should focus on refining language and grammar while expanding on their points with more detailed examples and insights into the cyclist's emotional and physical struggles. By addressing these areas for improvement, the essay can more effectively convey how environmental factors shape the cyclist's experience in the challenging desert setting."

The points about water scarcity, rough terrain, and isolation are well-explored, and the essay uses specific references from the text to support the analysis.

","This essay provides a basic understanding of the story's conclusion, highlighting Saeng's determination to continue despite her failure. However, the analysis could be expanded to explore the deeper meaning behind the imagery of the hibiscus and the geese.

Additionally, the connection to her past life and the new life she is building could be elaborated further. The essay would benefit from a more thorough examination of how the author uses these elements to express themes of resilience and renewal."

","This essay provides an interpretation of the story's conclusion, focusing on the idea of determination and growth. However, it introduces some confusion, such as the incorrect association of the test with gardening. While the spring and the hibiscus plant are clearly metaphors for renewal and new beginnings, the essay does not clearly link these elements to Saeng's personal growth and her specific struggle with the driving test. The explanation could benefit from a clearer focus on how the symbolism of the plant and spring ties into Saeng's emotional journey. Additionally, the essay lacks development in its argument and could be more coherent in its phrasing and structure."

","This essay attempts to connect the hibiscus and Saeng’s emotional growth, suggesting that she gains confidence from the plant and its survival. However, the explanation is somewhat unclear and lacks depth. The use of phrases like ""she will go again"" and ""growing with the hibiscus"" suggests an attempt to link Saeng’s personal growth with the plant, but these ideas are not fully explored or well-articulated. The language issues, such as inconsistent capitalization, detract from the clarity of the argument.

","This essay attempts to explain the significance of the story's conclusion, where Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring. The essay acknowledges the determination and willingness that Saeng exhibits through the line “take that test again,” implying her resilience and resolve. However, the explanation lacks depth and clarity. The connection between the spring season, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus could be explored further to show how these elements symbolize Saeng’s emotional journey and her personal growth. Additionally, the essay includes errors such as awkward phrasing (""she love it and want to do it"") and unclear sentence construction, which make it difficult to fully grasp the meaning. The writer could improve by clarifying how these symbols reflect Saeng’s determination to succeed and how they parallel her adaptation to her new life. There is also no mention of Saeng’s internal conflict or her homesickness, which are central to understanding her character’s transformation. To strengthen this analysis, the essay should focus on refining sentence structure, improving grammar, and providing a more comprehensive interpretation of the symbolic significance of the spring season and the hibiscus."

","This essay discusses the symbolic significance of the spring season, the blooming hibiscus, and the geese’s return as they relate to Saeng’s journey. The essay makes a good attempt at analyzing the author’s decision to conclude the story with Saeng’s vow to try the driving test again. The symbolism of the hibiscus blooming is well recognized, as it represents both Saeng’s past life and her new beginning. However, the essay would benefit from a more nuanced analysis of how these symbols specifically reflect Saeng's emotional and psychological growth. For instance, the essay touches on Saeng’s homesickness but could further explore how her connection to her past motivates her to try again. The explanation about the geese and the snow melting is relevant but could be expanded to illustrate how the change in seasons parallels Saeng’s own transformation. Additionally, the language and grammar could be improved for clarity and coherence. Some sentences, like “this girl just failed her driving test,” could be revised for better flow and professionalism. Despite these issues, the essay provides a solid foundation for understanding the symbolic ending but could be strengthened by deeper analysis and a clearer connection to Saeng’s character arc."
"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the �test� again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng�s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she �failed the test�, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow.""

","This essay provides a solid interpretation of the author’s conclusion, identifying the themes of perseverance and adaptation to change effectively. The writer connects Saeng’s willingness to take the test again to her emotional journey of confronting memories of her home without being overwhelmed by sorrow. This interpretation is insightful and highlights Saeng's personal growth as she learns to cope with the challenges of adapting to a new life. However, the analysis could benefit from more specific textual evidence to support the claims, such as how the hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng’s resilience. The language used is fairly clear, but some sentences could be more concise to enhance readability. The essay successfully conveys the connection between the theme of perseverance and Saeng’s determination to try again, but expanding on how the hibiscus plant represents her emotional and psychological resilience would make the analysis even stronger."

","This essay effectively analyzes the author’s decision to conclude the story with a strong statement of Saeng’s resolve, emphasizing her determination to pass the driving test. The closing lines capture Saeng’s inner strength, which has been nurtured by her memories of her grandmother and the symbolism of the hibiscus. These symbols serve not only as emotional anchors but also as sources of courage, reminding Saeng of her roots and the strength required to face the challenges in her new life. The narrative shifts from initial sadness and homesickness to one of empowerment, showing how Saeng’s journey is both a physical and emotional test. The essay’s emphasis on the contrast between Saeng's longing for the past and her growing determination for the future is well articulated. By linking Saeng’s vow to the seasonal symbols of spring and the geese’s return, the essay effectively highlights the cyclical nature of renewal and growth. The conclusion’s message of hope is reinforced through Saeng’s courage to face her homesickness and her readiness to embrace the future with confidence. This transformation reflects the power of memory and personal growth in overcoming adversity, and the author’s choice to end on a hopeful note strengthens the emotional impact of the story."
"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""The author decided to conclude the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s determination to adapt to her new life. In the third paragraph on the second page the author writes, �Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile� That atleast, she could hold onto.� After failing her driver�s test Saeng was feeling foreign and alone. She desperately looked to the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower brought back comforting memories for her, so she bought one of the plants and returned. After a discussion with her mother Saeng understands that she must cope with her new home, much like the flower must adapt to its new surroundings. By concluding the story, with that stated sentence, the author is informing the reader that Saeng must �blossom� in her new home in order to do well. She still needs time for this, as the flowers needs time to plant its roots into the ground.""
Essay Prompt: Read the last paragraph of the story. 'When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.' Write a response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. In your response, include details and examples from the story that support your ideas.

","This essay offers a strong analysis of the author's use of the hibiscus metaphor to illustrate Saeng's journey of adaptation. The connection between the flower's growth and Saeng's personal growth is effectively drawn, showcasing her emotional and physical struggle to adjust to her new life.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from addressing the significance of the mother's role in Saeng’s development."

","The essay demonstrates a better understanding of the memoir’s mood, highlighting moments that convey love and warmth.

","The essay attempts to convey the narrator's childhood and family history but falls short in clarity and organization. The content lacks sufficient detail, making it difficult for the reader to connect with the story. The narrative feels fragmented, and the essay would benefit from a more structured approach to effectively tell the family’s history and the significance of their experiences. Word choice is basic, and the overall language lacks precision, impacting the clarity of the message. There are several issues with grammar, such as missing punctuation and awkward phrasing, which detract from the readability. The essay is loosely connected to the prompt but fails to delve into the deeper emotional or reflective aspects expected. To improve, more specific details about the family’s background and a more cohesive narrative structure would enhance the overall effectiveness of the essay.

","This essay captures a nostalgic mood, reflecting on childhood memories that bring the author joy. The content offers an engaging look into the author’s experiences, but it could benefit from more detailed descriptions to enhance emotional impact. The organization is fairly structured, though the narrative could flow more smoothly with better transitions between ideas. Word choice is mostly effective, though some phrases feel repetitive, and more varied vocabulary could improve the overall clarity and richness of the narrative. Sentence fluency is decent, but the essay would benefit from sentence variety to avoid monotony. Conventions are followed adequately, but there are some minor issues with punctuation. The essay generally adheres to the prompt, capturing the themes of happiness and family, but more reflection on the significance of these memories could add depth. The language is clear, but could be more expressive to evoke stronger emotions. Narrativity is present, but more vivid sensory details and character descriptions would bring the story to life more fully.

","The essay provides a heartfelt reflection on the welcoming mood created by the author, focusing on the sacrifices of the parents and the warmth of the family environment. The content is thoughtful, but it lacks the depth and specificity that would make it more compelling. The organization is generally clear, but some sentences could be restructured to improve clarity and flow. Word choice is somewhat repetitive, and there is room to enhance the precision of vocabulary to better convey the warmth and emotional depth of the narrative. Sentence fluency could be improved by breaking up longer sentences and avoiding repetition for smoother readability. Conventions are generally followed, though there are minor grammatical issues. The essay aligns with the prompt but could explore the deeper emotional layers of the story to provide a more complete response. The language used is clear but could be more expressive to better convey the warmth and gratitude described. The narrative has potential but would benefit from more detailed descriptions to create a richer experience for the reader. Overall, the essay has good ideas but needs refinement in expression and depth."

","This essay successfully conveys a sense of gratefulness and warmth, capturing the author’s deep appreciation for their family and the traditions passed down. The content provides solid examples of the author’s feelings, such as specific memories of Cuban customs and the value of family, though it could dive deeper into the personal reflections on these experiences. The structure is clear, but more fluid transitions would enhance the cohesion of the narrative. Word choice is appropriate, though it sometimes falls short of creating a more vivid picture of the scenes and emotions being described. Sentence fluency is adequate, though occasionally repetitive; varying sentence length and structure would improve readability. Conventions are mostly observed, but some minor grammatical errors detract from the overall clarity. The essay does well in addressing the prompt, showing clear adherence to the theme of familial gratitude.

"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""In The """"Mooring Mast"""" by @ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large deregible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building which could cause the building to collapse. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast. One way to fix this would be to Place lead weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these problems the mast could never be used.""

","The essay provides a very brief discussion of the challenges faced in attempting to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, but it lacks sufficient detail to fully explore the obstacles. The content is minimal and does not provide enough context or explanation to convey the seriousness of the challenges. The organization is unclear, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner, and transitions are lacking. Word choice is basic, and there are several awkward phrasings that reduce clarity. Sentence fluency is poor, as the writing is choppy and repetitive, making it difficult to follow. Conventions are not consistently adhered to, with several grammatical errors and improper punctuation. The essay does not fully address the prompt, as it offers only a shallow examination of the obstacles without delving into their broader implications. Language use is not effective, and the tone is flat. The narrative is nearly absent, as the essay lacks any compelling storytelling or personal engagement.

"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""According to """"The Mooring Mast"""" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced three main obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was concern of public safety. Dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable element. An accident in a densely populated area like New York could be catastrophic. The second obstacle were the violent winds on top of the building. Using lead weights to tie down dirigibles was not practical, because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A mishap would send those heavy weights flying down and causing destruction. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building illegal and out of question""

","This essay briefly touches on the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, specifically regarding the challenges of adding a mooring mast for dirigibles. While it mentions the problem of the stress on the building caused by a dirigible, the content lacks depth and explanation. The essay would greatly benefit from further elaboration on the specific engineering or logistical issues. The organization is fairly weak, with the ideas feeling disconnected and the progression of thought unclear. The word choice is somewhat vague, and there is a noticeable lack of precision in describing the challenges. Sentence fluency is basic, and the repetitive structure hinders readability. Conventions are generally followed, though there are some issues with punctuation. The essay fails to fully address the prompt, lacking a thorough exploration of the challenges the builders faced. Language use is functional but not expressive, and the narrative is underdeveloped. The essay needs significant improvement in content, organization, and detail to meet the requirements of the prompt more effectively."
"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""The excerpt """"The Mooring Mast"""" by @ORGANIZATION2 is a story that takes the reader through the obstacles and attempts builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, four-term governor of New York, planned to construct the Empire State Building after he was in office.Smith was competitive and realized that the building was close to earning the title of world's tallest building. So in 1929 he announced that the building would be 1,250 feet and he would do this by adding a top or hat to the building which would be distinctive. The idea was to add a mooring mass and observation decks to the top and have it be able to dock dirigibles, or blimps. Architects later realized that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by one cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of a dirigible's load with the pressure of wind would go all the way to the building's foundation. The plans that have builders working so hard on frame work and observation decks failed. It was not practical to dock a dirigible, it wouldn't be safe. By the late 1930s, the idea was given up on, but the Empire State Building is still open to one of the observation decks and is a very popular attraction in New York.""

"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it with the high blowing winds. Safety was also an issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of cilvians. After the mast was constructed, the high speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were many obstacles getting in the way of making the idea successful.""

"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State went through many obstacles. They would first have to modify and strengthened the buildings frame to accommodate this new situation. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. After doing all of that work they then found out that the mast of the Empire State building would never work. The greatest reason was saftey. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. By the late 1930's the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes.""

","The essay is brief and attempts to discuss the importance of patience in relation to a test, but the content is too shallow to provide meaningful insights. The organization is poor, with a lack of logical structure, making it difficult to follow the writer’s thought process. Word choice is basic, with many words being used incorrectly, leading to confusion. Sentence fluency is compromised by incomplete thoughts and disjointed phrasing. While conventions are somewhat followed, there are multiple spelling and grammatical errors throughout the text. The essay doesn't fully engage with the prompt and fails to offer any significant reflections on patience. Language use is rudimentary and lacks expressiveness. To improve, the writer should focus on providing more detail, ensuring proper structure, and refining their language for better clarity."

","This essay provides an insightful reflection on patience, utilizing a personal anecdote to explore the concept in a relatable way. The content is relevant and engaging, with a strong emphasis on the writer’s emotional experience at the doctor’s office. The organization of the essay is clear, though the transitions between thoughts could be smoother to enhance the flow. Word choice is functional but lacks precision in some areas, particularly when describing emotions or actions. Sentence fluency is acceptable, but the repetition of phrases and long sentence structures slightly detract from the clarity.

","This essay describes a personal experience of waiting patiently for a turn to play games, reflecting on the value of patience and respect for siblings. The content is somewhat engaging, but it could benefit from additional depth and detail to make the story more vivid and impactful. The organization is somewhat disjointed, with the flow between sentences and ideas feeling a bit abrupt; improving the transitions would help tie the story together more effectively. The vocabulary is basic, and some word choices lack clarity, which affects the overall precision of the narrative. Sentence fluency could be enhanced by varying sentence structures, as some sentences are repetitive. While conventions are generally followed, there are some issues with grammar and punctuation, such as inconsistent use of apostrophes and tense. The essay adheres to the prompt but could be more reflective by expanding on the lesson learned from the experience. The tone is informal and suitable for the prompt, but it lacks a certain expressiveness that could make it more engaging. The narrative lacks some sensory details that could bring the story to life, making it feel more like a recounting rather than a compelling narrative. Overall, with improvements in structure, vocabulary, and sensory detail, the essay would be much stronger."

","This essay reflects on an experience of patience through a simple yet relatable scenario of waiting for a turn to run in a relay race. While the content is straightforward, the writing would be strengthened by adding more reflection on how patience played a role in the experience and its personal impact. The organization is fairly strong, though the flow of events could be improved by further elaborating on how the waiting contributed to personal growth or understanding. Word choice is basic, with room for more precise and descriptive language to heighten the impact of the narrative. Sentence fluency is acceptable, but the sentence structure could be more varied to keep the reader engaged. The conventions are mostly followed, but there are some punctuation and structure issues that need attention. The essay loosely adheres to the prompt, but a deeper exploration of patience within the context of the event would enhance its alignment. The language is functional but lacks emotional depth, and the narrativity could be more captivating with the inclusion of sensory details or internal reflection. In summary, this essay offers a simple story with room for growth in emotional engagement, detail, and refinement of the writing style."

","The essay presents a brief account of a time when the writer was sent to their room, offering a glimpse into their frustration with being confined. However, the content feels underdeveloped, lacking in detail or further insight into the writer's emotions or the situation. The organization of ideas is somewhat disjointed, making it hard to follow the sequence of events clearly. A clearer structure, with distinct moments of reflection or insight, would greatly improve coherence. Word choice is very basic and could be expanded to better convey the writer's feelings and the context of the situation. Sentence fluency is limited, with some sentences being short or repetitive, which diminishes the overall flow. Conventions are not consistently followed, with noticeable issues in spelling, punctuation, and grammar that distract from the narrative. The essay doesn’t fully align with the prompt, as there is little focus on patience or waiting, and more attention could be given to elaborating on the lessons learned or the writer's personal growth. Language usage is very casual and lacks the expressiveness needed to create an emotional connection with the reader. Narrativity is weak due to the minimal development of the events. The essay could greatly benefit from added depth, clearer organization, and attention to conventions to improve readability and engagement."

","This essay conveys a personal experience of patience while waiting in long lines at an amusement park. The content reflects the writer’s ability to convey frustration and perseverance, but it lacks depth in terms of personal reflection or learning from the experience. The organization is effective, with a clear chronological flow, but the transitions between events could be better tied together to strengthen the narrative's cohesiveness. Word choice is simple but adequate, though the vocabulary could be expanded to provide more nuance. Sentence fluency is choppy at times, particularly with repetitive structures, which could be varied for smoother flow. Conventions are somewhat adhered to, though there are consistent punctuation and grammatical mistakes that hinder the overall quality. The essay is somewhat aligned with the prompt but could delve deeper into the emotional impact or the broader significance of the experience. The language captures a casual tone, but it could be more engaging to draw the reader into the experience. Narrativity is present but limited; further development of the characters and setting could enhance the story.

","The essay recounts an incident where the writer and their brother experience a breakdown on the freeway, leading to a humorous situation with their parents. While the content is engaging and relatable, the narrative lacks clarity in some areas, such as the sequence of events and the use of specific details. The organization is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions that disrupt the flow of the story. The word choice is straightforward but could benefit from more vivid descriptions to paint a clearer picture. Sentence fluency is adequate, but the repetitiveness in some parts could be reduced to maintain reader interest. There are a few grammatical issues, such as inconsistent punctuation, that slightly hinder readability. The essay adheres to the prompt by presenting a personal experience, but it could delve deeper into the emotions or lessons learned from the situation.

","Your essay emphasizes the importance of laughter in relationships, portraying it as an essential tool for emotional well-being. The central message is clear, but the organization of ideas could be improved to create a more logical flow. For instance, the essay jumps between topics without smooth transitions, making it harder to follow. To strengthen this, consider grouping similar thoughts together and using linking sentences to guide the reader. The simplicity of your word choice works well in making the essay accessible, though some terms could be more precise to enhance clarity and impact. Your sentence fluency would benefit from greater variation in structure—this would help maintain reader interest and improve the overall rhythm of the writing. There are also some punctuation and grammar issues, particularly with capitalization and sentence construction, which should be addressed to improve consistency. While the tone is conversational, which suits the topic, tightening the structure and refining the language would make your message even more powerful."
"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: ""@CAPS1.., that is a sound i love to hear, laughter. Laughter plays a big roll in my life. To me it is the only thing that can keep me going. Sometimes it is even better then ice cream, and that is saying a lot. I have had many different experiences in life that laughter has been a big part of. Like @CAPS6 my brother got sent back to jail. @CAPS6 I was @CAPS5 I had to laugh because it was the only thing that made me feel good inside. Also, @CAPS6 i got dumped like last nights garbage, laughter made me feel as if nothing had ever happened. So @CAPS6 people are not feeling the best or are going through struggles in their life, I truly believe that laughter will make everything feel a little bit better. ""@CAPS2!"", it hit me like a brick in the head. Hearing that my brother got put back in jail was a hard thing to hear. He had just gotten out from a four month sentence, three months ago. One of the hardest things is thinking of what to say @CAPS6 his three year old son, @PERSON1, asks ""@CAPS3's @CAPS4?"". The main reason I'm not as scared for my brother as I was is because of my nephew @PERSON1. He can light up any situation with his adorable laugh. So whenever my brother gets thrown back into jail, I know everything will be okay @CAPS6 I see a big smile on @PERSON1's little chubby face. He is my inspiration to smile @CAPS6 I feel like there is absolutely nothing in this word to smile or laugh about. Even @CAPS6 we were both sitting in the emergency room he still just kept on laughing.  Being @CAPS5 is the absolute worst thing in the world to me. I hate not being able to get out of bed and go places. All I usually do is go stuff outside with my friends, but @CAPS6 I'm @CAPS5 I cant do anything. The only things I can really do is take nasty medicine. Recently I was in the hospital with very severe abdominal pains. Then not even two weeks later I was back in the emergency room with strep. I was in a lot of pain for about four weeks all together. one thing I hate more then being @CAPS5, is people feeling bad for me being @CAPS5. So whenever I'm @CAPS5 I always crack jokes and make people laugh no matter how much it hurts me to laugh. Even though the laughing did not feel good physically, it sure made me feel a lot better emotionally. Laughing is like my brand of medicine for @CAPS6 I'm not feeling well. It seems to make me feel better faster then any other over the counter medicine. Especially for breaking up with my first ""love"". ""I just don't want my mistakes to hurt you anymore"", that was the last thing he said to me. My first ""love"" just left me standing alone on a staircase to drown in my own tears. It was my first real break-up. I was having a pretty hard time dealing with it. Then the day after we broke up my friends came and picked me up. They told me that I needed to be cheered up. @CAPS6 we got into town we stopped by the store. My friend @PERSON3 told me to pick out a half gallon of ice-cream, so I got mint chocolate chip. We finally got to @PERSON3's house and he told me that I had to eat the whole half gallon of ice cream to myself. Of course I didn't argue. While I was eating the ice cream him and my friend @PERSON2 put on a little skit of how they were going to be up my ex boyfriend. I was laughing so hard I got a brain freeze. By the time the skit was over I was rolling on the floor laughing. All the laughing made me forget that I was sad in the first place. I felt that just having a good laugh with my friends brought us closer together. While I was with my ex we never hung out because i was always with him. I had a blast that day and I will remember it forever. Laughing is truly the key to living a great life. ""@CAPS6 life gives you lemons make lemonade"", that is a quote that I chose to listen to and try to follow. To me the quote is just saying to enjoy the little things in life. So whenever I laugh, I am enjoying a little pleasures in life. Laughing is a part of my life no matter how hard life @MONTH1 seem. So even if my brother is in jail, I'm @CAPS5, or i just got dumped; I laugh so that I don't have to worry anymore. Laughter is a main ingredient to everyone's life, don't forget it or life wont turn out the way that anyone would want it.   ""

","The essay offers a sincere reflection on the importance of laughter in overcoming life’s challenges. The narrative flows with genuine emotion, highlighting various personal moments where laughter has played a key role in providing comfort during tough situations, such as family struggles and illness. The content is heartfelt but could benefit from more depth or additional context to elevate the emotional impact further. The organization and flow of ideas are clear, though transitions between different anecdotes could be smoother to enhance coherence. Word choice and sentence fluency are adequate but could be improved with more varied vocabulary and sentence structure for greater clarity and engagement. There is consistent adherence to conventions, but some minor errors are present, and the tone could be more polished. While the essay successfully conveys the emotional value of laughter, it would be stronger with more refined writing that addresses the structural and grammatical inconsistencies."

Even the people that you always see smiling, they had the most serious look on they're face. it was just a bad day. But then one of our friends, @PERSON1, had a great idea of going online to find something to cheer us up. It truly was a amazing idea. We spent hours on the computer just sitting there looking up ridiculous videos that we knew about. Trying to make each other laugh. That's when our day started to be a bit better. But it went back down a bit when a few people left to go home. Only three of us were still at @LOCATION1's house. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I were all sitting there watching @LOCATION2 when a show we all loved came on. Psych. It was a new episode too! what a great day it turned out to be. The show is full of really puny and dumb humor but it fit all three of us. @PERSON1 the most. We were all laughing and having a good time. @PERSON1 was laughing after the show was over. So we asked what was so funny. He just kept laughing. For five minuets he was laughing. when he finally stopped we asked again. What was so darn funny. then he told us. """" I was laughing at my own laugh. I sound really weird.

","This essay effectively conveys a shift from a difficult day to a more uplifting moment through humor, reflecting the writer's ability to engage with both the emotional tone of the situation and the comedy of a light-hearted moment. The content, though relevant to the prompt, lacks depth in its exploration of emotions and the impact of laughter. The narrative is engaging, but it feels somewhat superficial, with room for further insight or reflection on the meaning of the experience. Organization could be improved, as the transitions between events (e.g., from watching videos to laughing at the show) feel abrupt and disrupt the flow. Word choice is generally clear, but occasionally lacks precision (e.g., ""a amazing"" instead of ""an amazing""), and there are some awkward phrases that could be smoothed out for clarity. Sentence fluency is acceptable but could benefit from greater variation in structure to avoid repetitive patterns. Conventions need attention, especially with issues like ""they're"" instead of ""their"" and inconsistent punctuation. While the essay adheres to the prompt, a more thoughtful reflection on the broader significance of laughter would strengthen the conclusion. Language use suits the informal tone but could be more varied to enhance expressiveness. Narratively, the story is pleasant, but adding more vivid details or emotional depth would make the experience more compelling. Overall, this essay captures the essence of laughter but needs work in terms of structure, depth, and grammatical accuracy."
"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: "" So many people sing songs and write stories about sad depressing events, like it's the only thing life consists of. We seem to never stop and focus on the little things. If we could stop and appreciate those little things, everyone would realize just how much they really have. In some way or another we all seek pity and for some reason we want to have the worse story. Like it's some sort of competition. I personally don't want to have the worse story. If you just """"go with it"""" things seem more lighthearted, care free, and people would rather be around someone that makes them feel good and happy than someone that makes them feel sad. There is many times where I could have chosen to stay mad and upset, but instead I chose to just laugh, and not make a big deal out of a small mistake. For example, @DATE1 was the @CAPS1 dance. I was supposed to be there early to finish decorating, but I was late (like always). It didn't really matter that I was late because when I got there I found out that it was canceled. By the time they decided to cancel it (due to a power outage) my parents already drove away and they didn't have their cell phones with them. I was stuck at the school. While I was trying to get hold of somebody to pick me up, two of my friends showed up, even though I told them that the dance was canceled. My friend's mom was nice enough to come pick us up. We met the rest of our friends downtown, where we decided to go to @LOCATION1's and play arcade games. We had an amazing time! We all got matching rings and I got two lollipops. When we were done we went up to our friends house, where we watched movies and ate popcorn. I had eaten way to much sugar and was super hyper! I kept saying a ton of random things, but it made for a great evening full of laughing. I could have been really upset that the dance was canceled, all of us could have, but we made the most out of what we had and ended up having a really good time. And I personally think it was more fun than the dance would have been. Another example is when I was a freshman. There was one day that seem particularly hard. I felt like nobody wanted to be my friend or hang out with me. I remember sitting in the hall by myself, feeling like nobody cared. A senior that year came up to me and started talking to me. I remember him telling me that it's harder frown than it is to smile. I realized that he was absolutely right. Even though smiling takes more muscles, frowning in the long run has a worse effect. If I could go back to that day I wouldn't be such a drama queen. I was making a big deal out of something that wasn't even true. I always say things that I latter regret, but if I just """"go with it"""" it doesn't seem near as bad. If I could, I would write a dozen songs that have no sad or depressing meaning. Or a millions books based on the happiest things in life. If you fall down, it's better to laugh than to run away crying. What won't kill you will make you stronger. Lots of things make you stronger, like: breakups, heartaches, @CAPS2.E class, and of course laughing. Laughing also makes you live longer; so why wouldn't you laugh as much as you possible could?""

"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: "" """"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"""" @CAPS3 quote can be agreed by everyone on @LOCATION1. Everyone loves to laugh and have a good time. Especially @CAPS1 with a person you care about. @CAPS1 is something you and another person can do together with ease. @CAPS3 brings two people closer together and brightens a person's life. Some people, like me, are always looking for a guy who knows how to make me smile and laugh. I need to know that arguing isn't going to be the main part of @CAPS3 relationship. Having someone who makes you laugh is a key factor in life. At the age of sixteen I had my first boyfriend. I was the girl who kept on rejecting guys and telling them I was trying to wait for that perfect guy. In the @DATE2 I met @ORGANIZATION2. Even though he was older than me and we might be opposites, he always knows how to make me smile. My first impression of him was his cute smile. After getting to know him and talking on the phone a couple of times I realized that I started to have feelings for @CAPS3 boy. Whenever we talked he always had me @CAPS1. I found @CAPS3 very attractive. Having someone who brings some sunshine into my life made me feel like I was on top of the world. On @DATE1 there was a football game, @ORGANIZATION1 (two schools who are rivals). During @CAPS3 time him and I still weren't dating. That day I invited him to come over so we could watch the game together. I had previously told him how I love stuffed animals. That day he showed up with a fluffy stuffed animal. We were walking around the track, @CAPS2 all of a sudden I tripped. My first reaction was to use my nervous laugh. He had his arm around me and whispered in my ear """"I would never let you @DATE3."""" I turned cherry red. From that day on he will remember me as the clumpsy girl who trips all the time. Now that i look back at the day I realize how funny that memory was. Looking back at embarrassing moments is always a good thing in a relationship.  @CAPS2 you are looking for someone who you want to spend the rest of your life together you have to make sure you like them for whom they are. You don't want them to change. The goal is to be able to spend time with someone who you can have a good time with and crack some jokes around. I always tell my friends """"@CAPS1 is a great ab workout."""" Which is true because whenever I laugh, my abs are always sore the next day. Being able to have a good time with friends, and laugh about random stuff is always something I look forward to. If there is no @CAPS1 going on, then that means I'm not having a good time. But lucky me, I have amazing friends who make jokes about everything. Whenever I'm around them there is never a moment @CAPS2 I'm not @CAPS1. Being able to make others laugh is a great characteristic in a person.  @CAPS2 you meet a new person, would you rather have awkward silence? Or do you prefer someone who will make you laugh? I'm hoping we have the same answer, because I hate awkward silence. I need to know that @CAPS3 person will make me laugh and smile and not make me be thinking """"@CAPS2 will I be able to leave?"""" @CAPS3 is one of the worst situations anyone would want to go through, I can say @CAPS3 from personal experience. Even though I'm not the best at saying jokes, I use all my embarrassing moments and thats my way I have people @CAPS1. I don't get mad about it, I'm the total opposite. I laugh along with them. I know I'm clumpsy, I know I have my moments, and if these things can bring a smile to a persons face, then I'm @PERCENT1 fine with it. My goal is to be able to make people smile @CAPS2 they are down. So instead of cracking a joke, I just remind them of an embarrassing thing that has happened to me. Everyone is unique in their own ways. That's what makes everyone special. Different people have different ways of making others laugh. And once a guy gets a girl to laugh, that's the first sign @CAPS3 guy was meant for them. Having someone who can make you smile is a key factor in life. @CAPS1 means that you are having a good time. @CAPS1 brings people together. @CAPS1 can brighten a persons life. So next time you meet someone, maybe a joke here and there will help you break the ice.""

We all know that every relationship needs a heaping dosage of medicine every once and a while.  @CAPS3 younger brother, @PERSON1, and I, we have a pretty good relationship. Sometimes we argue, other times we can get along like we are the best of friends. When we were going to the same school together, I would go out of @CAPS3 way to say hi to @CAPS3 brother. Almost every time I would get shut down and ignored, by @CAPS3 own brother. @PERSON1 is going to be a freshman next year and I will be a junior, so we will be attending high school together. One night, at the dinner table, @CAPS3 family was discussing what the change would be like with both children in high school. I brought up the fact that @PERSON1 never says hi to me or even waves at me and how I didn't really appreciate it.  Some how we got to talking about how he would be known as @LOCATION1's brother because I am so awesome. The next thing I know @PERSON1 blurted out, """"yeah, @LOCATION1, I'm going to embarrass you because I am so butt-ugly."""" @CAPS3 parents and I looked at each other and instantly started laughing and couldn't stop! When we had semi regained our composure, we asked @PERSON1 why he would say something like that about himself. @PERSON1 said he didn't really know why he said that, he thought it would be funny. Yes, @PERSON1, it was!! It was @CAPS3 turn to pray for dinner that night. As much and as hard as I tried to compose myself long enough to pray, I couldn't do it. Every time I thought I had pulled myself together again, I would start busting up yet again. After a while, @CAPS3 parents asked me what was wrong. I replied, """"I was going to ask @CAPS4 to make @PERSON1 more beautiful so he wouldn't embarrass me."""" I started laughing so hard that I was crying. I couldn't see anything because the tears had blurred @CAPS3 vision. Now, after what I said, it took me twice as long to control @CAPS3 laughter. @CAPS3 parents calmed down before I did, so @CAPS3 mom had to pray because I couldn't contain myself. The whole time @CAPS3 mom was praying, I had to clamp @CAPS3 hand over @CAPS3 mouth to keep from laughing. @CAPS3 grip was so hard that it made @CAPS3 teeth hurt. That night I think @CAPS3 whole family got a few spoonfuls of medicine. Probably enough to last us another week or so. I can't wait until I get 'sick' again and need another serving of medicine! ""

I was eight at the time. I'd lived in @LOCATION1 all my life, and hearing other languages wasn't something that happened on a regular basis. When my @CAPS3 announced that her college roommate @PERSON3 was coming for a few days along with her family, I felt some apprehension at the idea of trying to talk to them. However, my @CAPS3 was encouraging. """"@CAPS4 will be a learning experience!"""" was her enthusiastic war cry any time I whined. """"@CAPS5'll learn some @CAPS6, and @CAPS19'll learn some @CAPS7.""""  @CAPS4 was a cold, stormy @ORGANIZATION2 day when @CAPS19 arrived. As @CAPS19 pulled their blue minivan into our driveway, I @CAPS12 felt shy. After all, I only had faint memories of my """"@CAPS9"""" @PERSON3's visit years ago, and I'd never met the rest of her family. However, my sense of worry was soon replaced by @CAPS9 @PERSON3's rich voice: """"@CAPS11! @CAPS5've gotten so tall!"""" @CAPS12 I was enfolded in her warm embrace, and I smelled the familiar smell of my @CAPS9: chocolate, detergent, and something spicy as if she'd just been cooking. Soon @ORGANIZATION1 had moved on to greeting my younger sister and I was left awkwardly standing next to @ORGANIZATION1's three children. I realized that I didn't know @CAPS2 to say- or even how to say anything to them. While @PERSON3 was bilingual, yet she didn't speak @CAPS7 around her children. There was a total @CAPS1 barrier. The awkwardness passed momentarily when the adults intervened. @PERSON3 bustled into our silent mass and began introducing us. Her oldest was tall, dark haired @PERSON1, who was the ancient and worldly age of twelve. Closest to my age was nine year old @CAPS14, who had a quick smile and a mischievous glint in her eye. The youngest, @PERSON2, was petite even for her tender age of four. I smiled and nodded as each was introduced, and smiled and nodded some more as @PERSON3 introduced me and my sister @CAPS15 to them. As @CAPS19 chattered back at her in @CAPS6, I marveled at how clever @CAPS19 seemed for speaking another @CAPS1. How, I wondered, did my @CAPS7 sound to them?  My @CAPS3 soon ushered us into the house. She had begun making dinner, and @PERSON3 joined her in our small kitchen to """"catch up on life."""" For a while, we kids stayed close to our parents, like birds hesitating to leave the nest. Soon, however, @CAPS4 became apparent that seven people was too many to fit in one kitchen. """"@CAPS18 don't @CAPS5 go show them your rooms?"""" my @CAPS3 suggested. """"@CAPS19 still haven't met @CAPS20!"""" @CAPS21 seemed like a good idea, since @CAPS20, our cat, was friendly to anyone and everyone. @CAPS15 and I led the way to to find him while the @CAPS23 talked in hushed @CAPS6 voices behind us.  As we got to the living room, @PERSON2 @CAPS12 let out a squeal. She ran across the floor to @CAPS20, who had been napping in the sun. I was worried that she would startle him, but the overweight tabby simply got up sleepily and yawned. And then, to our amazement, @CAPS20 did something he'd never done before. He jumped up and placed his hind legs on @PERSON2's chest. He was a large cat, and she was small, so @CAPS4 turned out so that he was looking her in the eye. For a moment, @CAPS19 looked at each other, surprised, and then she fell down into a sitting position. Worried she might cry, I started to go over to help, but then something entirely different escaped out of her mouth: the contagious laugh of a four year old. For a moment, there was a surprised silence from the rest of us as she howled at the hilarity of @CAPS4, but soon we couldn't help but join in. And in that moment, I realized that we didn't even have to learn each other's languages- the laughter that we'd shared had broken the ice and the @CAPS1 barrier.  I still remember that visit fondly today, because @CAPS4's the first time that I realized how alike other cultures are to our own. True, we had a hard time relating at the beginning. But by the end, we had become friends, all because of a cat, a four year old, and the one @CAPS1 we did have in common- laughter.""

At the start of @DATE1 the school held try outs and the teams were decided. After graduating seniors and some players not coming out, or team was brand new. Full with all different ages of players. we all were civil with each other at practices but we weren't all best friends that wanted to hang out outside of practice. The @CAPS1 team decided to take a retreat to the beach and stay @CAPS2 for a weekend.  When we went to leave to the beach our phones were taken and we had assigned seats in the cars. This trip seemed like it was going to be a long one with out my phone. We arrived at the house @TIME1. As we all found somewhere to relax, shower or sleep myself and most of the team ended up in the living room conversing with the coaches. we all sat on the floor recalling stories about the game from that @TIME1 or funny stories from our past. By the time we finished telling stories it had reached @TIME2 and everyone in the house was either tired or hungry.  As we sat on the floor complaining about tiredness or hunger we all started to turn our attention to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 was starting to go on a tirade about how hungry she was. In her opinion she thought the house we were staying in should of already been stoked with food for us for when we got @CAPS2, but @CAPS2 was no food. As she continued on her rant she became more and more mad which made us laugh harder and harder. Finally she reached her point. """"@CAPS2's no steak or chicken up in these mother freak-in cabinets."""" @PERSON1 proclaimed. At that point the coaches and players started laughing uncontrollable. @PERSON1 didn't understand why it was so funny, but we kept laughing and laughing at the fact that she just said that @CAPS2 should be steak and chicken in the cabinets. The outburst of laughter continued on for the next five to ten minutes.  When we finally started to calm down @PERSON2 came down stairs. She had missed everything that had happened and as we went to fill her in @LOCATION1 stopped us. """"@PERSON2 @CAPS4 up on the counter and look in the cabinet,"""" @PERSON1 said. @PERSON2 hesitantly got up on the counter and slowly started to open the cabinet. When she opened the cabinet she looked inside and all she could see was chips. She turned around and looked at @LOCATION1. """"@CAPS3?"""" asked @PERSON2. As she turned to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 just sat @CAPS2 smiling. Then she finally answered the question. """"@CAPS4 me some of those chips right @CAPS2!"""" @PERSON1 said.  Everyone in the room started laughing as @PERSON2 was so confused to why she was asked to @CAPS4 on a counter just so she could @CAPS4 @PERSON1 chips, who had been sitting next to the counter the whole @TIME1. The whole basketball team started laughing again. @PERSON2 got down from the counter but with no chips in hand. We all continued laughing and kept talking about @CAPS3 had just happened for the next @NUM1 minutes.  As everyone finally started to settle into their beds for the @TIME1 @CAPS2 were still those moments of """"@CAPS5 when this was said"""", and """"@CAPS5 when she did this"""".

The love for basketball, and most of all the ability to be able to come together as a team all because of the memories we shared that @TIME1 in the kitchen.

","This essay explores a memorable moment of laughter within a basketball team, capturing the bonding experience during a beach retreat. The story provides a solid example of how humor helps unite a group, and the anecdotes about the teammate's hilarious outburst add charm to the narrative. However, while the content is engaging, it feels somewhat repetitive, especially the constant reference to laughter without enough deeper reflection on its impact. The narrative structure could be improved, as the events sometimes feel disjointed, making it difficult to follow the sequence of moments clearly. Transitions could be smoother, allowing for a better flow from one part of the story to another. Sentence fluency suffers slightly due to some awkward phrasing and a lack of variety in sentence structure. Word choice is appropriate but could be more precise and impactful. Some grammatical errors, particularly with punctuation, also detract from the overall clarity of the writing. More careful attention to conventions and a clearer structure would significantly improve the essay's effectiveness in conveying its message."

","This essay explores the significance of laughter in relationships, presenting a thoughtful perspective on how humor can enhance connections. The score indicates a moderate level of effectiveness, suggesting that while there are strengths, there are also areas needing improvement.

"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: "" Laughter has been a nonchalant but steady and strong force for me in many relationships. I believe that laughter is useful in getting to know people you've just met and growing closer to people you care about. In my opinion @CAPS2 brings people closer and can change a bad situation upside down. Getting enough bravery to gain new friends, ask this girl out and eventually develop a good relationship with her, is where laughter played an important role. @CAPS2 was the @DATE1 I was fifteen and a sophomore at @ORGANIZATION1 school. @CAPS2 was my first year there. I have been to many schools, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 wood, etc. and like any new school I was having a hard time connecting on a social level with my peers. Everyday I woke up, got ready, went to school, got home did homework (maybe), and went to bed . @CAPS2 was a boring cycle that I seemed to be trapped in. The image of being cool and trying to fit in did not seem to work so much. Because one thing I realized was that trying to be cool and something you're not only gets you so far. The one thing that kids, people in general, like is when you're real and being yourself . I found that out later on, but I actually didn't realize that's what people liked the most. I said to myself one time that I didn't like trying to act like someone or something because the truth was I actually thought that I was a cool person deep down. So I changed my ways I stopped trying to act cool, and acted like myself. And @CAPS2 turned out that I actually was cool and that girls actually found me attractive, and not only attractive but a funny person that was likable. My main attribute, well besides my looks was my ability to make people laugh or at least smile. @CAPS2 gained me many friends that I didn't have in the beginning. @CAPS2 even gained me one of the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Her name was @LOCATION2, in my eyes there was no girl that could compare to her in any way. She had the body of a coca cola bottle, caramel skin, and the face of a goddess ( and I'm not exaggerating). Like any beautiful girl she had many followers and admirers who were similar to me. So what chance did I have? What did I, @PERSON1 have to offer her? Laughter. My greatest attribute that had come to my rescue many of times. Even though @CAPS2 didn't last as long as I would have liked @CAPS2( forever) @CAPS2 was great being with her for as long as I did, the things we got to do and the many experiences we had together, are priceless. And @CAPS2 was all because of my ability to make her laugh and to put a smile on her face. I believe that without laughter this world would not be the place that @CAPS2 is today. Sure, there is still crime and many horrors and atrocity's committed today, but imagine how horrid @CAPS2 would be without laughter. Joy, which I believe is the core of what laughter brings, allows us to forgive and forget. @CAPS2 allows us to turn our heads and overlook things. Without us being able to laugh how could we expect to survive the future""

","Laughter played a pivotal role in your personal growth, helping you connect with others and navigate a new environment. Your essay effectively conveys how humor helped build friendships and relationships, particularly with a significant other. The personal anecdotes offer a relatable touch, illustrating how humor can change social dynamics. However, the organization and structure could be more cohesive, as some ideas feel disconnected. To improve, consider refining the flow of events to ensure smoother transitions between different points in your story. Your word choice is clear, though some phrases could be more impactful. For instance, using more vivid descriptors in places where you mention the girl could strengthen your narrative. While your sentence fluency is generally smooth, you could vary the length and structure of your sentences to enhance rhythm and engagement. There are also some grammatical inconsistencies—correcting these will polish your essay and improve readability. Despite these areas for improvement, your essay does a great job of showing the importance of laughter in relationships and how it can foster connection."
"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: "" During the @DATE1 of the sixth grade @CAPS4 parents decided they were getting a divorce. I got the phone call when I was at @CAPS4 best friend @PERSON1's house.   """"@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 father"""" @CAPS4 @CAPS5 said through the phone to me.   """"@CAPS6 @CAPS5, @CAPS8's @CAPS9?"""" I asked him.   """"@CAPS10 need to come home, @CAPS10 @CAPS18 has served me today with divorce papers."""" @CAPS12 told me. I could feel the tears starting to swell @CAPS9 in @CAPS4 eyes. I had no clue @CAPS8 was happening, I was only @NUM1 and vaguely knew @CAPS8 divorce was. Without saying a word to him, I hung @CAPS9 the phone and ran into @PERSON1's room. I knew that the divorce would change things for me, but I didn't realize to @CAPS8 extent.   I stayed at @LOCATION1's house for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see @CAPS4 @CAPS18 or @CAPS4 father. At night I drempt about @CAPS8 @CAPS4 sisters were going through, the horror that they had to endure while I was away. I wondered @CAPS8 @CAPS4 father was doing, where @CAPS4 @CAPS18 was, and whether or not @CAPS4 sisters were @CAPS13. Even though I knew I should have gone home at one point during those two weeks, I didn't.  During those two weeks at @LOCATION1's house, I felt safe and secure, but not once did I feel happy. It was an emotion that I had longed for, but all the times that I tried to smile, tried to laugh, tried to be myself, I couldn't. I knew that something had changed in me when I hung @CAPS9 the phone on @CAPS4 father. I had never hung @CAPS9 on anyone before. It was something that I knew I shouldn't have done, but I was so upset, I did it anyways.  When @CAPS4 @CAPS18 came to pick me @CAPS9 after @CAPS4 two week extended stay at @LOCATION1's, she looked at me with concern in her eyes. I had never seen this emotion in @CAPS4 @CAPS18 before. She usually was so calm and in control. I had never seen her so concerned or upset. I knew that she was concerned for me. I also knew that @PERSON1's @CAPS14 had called mine several times during @CAPS4 stay. I assume she told her about how I was acting, but @CAPS8 was I supposed to do? @CAPS4 parents were splitting @CAPS9! @CAPS4 whole life was being flushed down the toilet. I knew that nothing would ever be the same and it killed me inside.  No one spoke on the ride home. I could feel the tension building as we turned onto @CAPS4 street and drove towards @CAPS4 house. When we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car and ran to @CAPS4 room, leaving @CAPS4 things on the back seat of the sedan. For two days, I didn't eat or sleep. I just laid in @CAPS4 bed longing for @CAPS4 father to come home. I had never gone to bed without @CAPS4 father tucking me in, never woke @CAPS9 in the @TIME1 on @CAPS4 own. There were so many things that @CAPS4 father did that @CAPS12 wasn't there to do anymore.  Things didn't start to get better until @CAPS4 @CAPS18 sent me and @CAPS4 sisters to @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house in @LOCATION2. I don't know why, but when I was there, I felt that same sense of safeness and security that I felt when I was at @LOCATION1's house. Even though I felt safe and secure, it still wasn't the same. It had been several weeks since I had visited @PERSON1, and I was dying to go back to her house. I knew that that was the only place that I could actually recover from @CAPS8 was happening. @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house was nice and all, but it didn't feel like home, I didn't think that anywhere I stayed would feel right. All I knew is that I needed @CAPS4 @CAPS5, not @CAPS4 @CAPS17 or @CAPS4 @CAPS18, just @CAPS4 @CAPS5, and maybe @PERSON1.  When I came home from @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house, I made arrangements to go over to @LOCATION1 house. I knew that I would be staying awhile, so I packed extra. When I got there, I told her about @CAPS8 was going on and how @CAPS4 sisters were doing. On the night that I arrived, we decided that we would go to the river the next day. I thought it was an alright idea. The next day we went to the river, her brothers decided to join us. Her brother @PERSON2 wanted to prove to us how much of a man @CAPS12 was, so @CAPS12 jumped off of the largest rock at the river. I thought it would be a perfect cannon ball, but it wasn't. @CAPS12 landed on his stomach for the perfect belly flop. I couldn't contain myself, I burst out laughing, I don't think i stopped laughing for several minutes. It was by far the best day I had since the day @CAPS4 father called me at @LOCATION1's house.""

","This essay conveys a deeply personal and emotional story about experiencing parental divorce. The writer does well to illustrate their emotional journey through vivid imagery and reflection. The content score suggests there are areas where more depth and insight could enhance the narrative. Specific moments of confusion and emotional conflict are poignant, but further elaboration on these feelings would provide a richer understanding of the emotional toll. In terms of organization, the narrative flows well, but some sections could benefit from clearer transitions to guide the reader more smoothly through the shifts in time and setting. The writing uses basic vocabulary, and while it effectively communicates emotions, there is room to improve word choice to enhance precision and clarity. Sentence fluency is uneven, with some choppy or overly simplistic constructions; varying sentence structure could add greater rhythm and engagement. Conventions are generally adhered to, but there are a few minor grammar and punctuation issues that should be corrected to improve readability. The essay adheres to the prompt by focusing on a personal story, though the reflection on the emotional implications of the event could be developed further. Overall, the essay captures a vulnerable moment but could benefit from more detailed introspection and refined language to elevate its emotional and narrative impact."

","This essay highlights the role of laughter in improving relationships and alleviating tension. The anecdote about a classroom presentation is relatable, though the essay lacks a clear structure, making it harder to follow. The flow between sentences is somewhat jarring, with awkward phrasing and unclear connections between ideas. Word choice could be more precise to convey the message more effectively, as some phrases are confusing or repetitive. Grammar issues, such as inconsistent verb tenses and missing articles, hinder the clarity of the narrative. A stronger introduction and conclusion would help frame the central message, and improving sentence fluency and structure would make the essay more engaging. The essay would benefit from more detailed examples to support the points made and a clearer connection to the main thesis."
"You are a helpful assistant that generates feedback for essays.","Essay: "" I agree when people say laughter is what mostly brings people together. In my opinion, @NUM1 of the time your talking to someone, laughter is needed. It is what brings the dullness out of a person, and makes the conversation interesting. Only when you are talking about something serious, you dont need to include laughter, but ill explain later. So I can easily tell a true story about laughter from my life. Right now i have a perfect group of friends. Sure there are times when they mess up and act like kids, but i feel like i need to forgive and remember that they are there when i need them. Anyways, i can remember the first time i met each one of them, and the one thing that started our friendship was a joke. I can't exactly remember which joke we shared, but i do remember that we all had the same taste in comedy. And once we saw that neither of us were serious and dull people, made us want to spend more time with eachother. That is why laughter builds a string between different people, and brings them closer together day by day. So as time passed, my friends and i were really drawn to eachother. What i mean is that, from time to time, we were happy to express our friendship through jokes. Sometimes the jokes are really stupid. Many of them have caused pain - physically, and have caused us to bring revenge on eachother. But that is just how, we stay close to eachother. Day by day, when we see something funny on the television, internet, or real life, we always show it to eachother, and know that after showing this prank, or whatever it is, the other person will find it very funny. It makes us feel closer, and know we all have a same taste in atleast one field. I can give one clear example of this: I was watching a comedy once, and the comedian was talking about his childhood, and a prank he once played on a strangers house. Right when i saw this video, i knew right away, my friends had to see this, because i knew from past experiences, that they enjoy these types of laughs. And i was right, as soon as they saw the show, they were amazed at how funny it was, and they were glad i shared it with them, we got closer than ever. I want to share one more example from my life, about laughter bringing two people closer. So after telling you that laughter gets me closer with friends, i also want to point out that laughter brings out a sence of outline when if you talk to girls - or boys, if you're a female. So i met this one girl, and everytime i talked to her, everytime i had to throw in a joke or a story that would make sence to our subject. After a while, she started joking around, and making stories too. She told me that she saw me as a different guy, comparing me to other people. She said that she meant i wasnt a boring type of person, and that it kept her wanting to keep talking to me. I always hoped not to be a dull person, and jokes made that not happen. Now, me and this girl are closer than ever, and the root that started this relationship was laughter. So as you see, laughter makes any relationship happy and open. Of course im talking about the relationships that are playful, i meant there are people out there that take everything serious, and can't take a joke. But i would really encourage you to take laughter in your life, if you already havent. Look in my life, i used laughter, and gained a lot of friends, of all sorts - just by joking around about something stupid. You don't have to say stupid things, but I say it would really make your life more interesting if you use laughter.""

","This essay effectively discusses the role of laughter in building friendships and relationships, providing personal anecdotes that illustrate its significance. The score reflects a solid level of effectiveness; however, there are still opportunities for enhancement. The content is engaging and showcases how humor can forge connections among friends; consider elaborating on specific moments that highlight these experiences further. Organization is generally sound but could benefit from clearer transitions between paragraphs to improve overall coherence.

Sentence fluency is good overall, yet varying your sentence structures will create a more dynamic reading experience. Additionally, pay attention to grammatical conventions to ensure clarity in your writing. This essay has a strong foundation but would benefit from deeper examples and improved organizational clarity."
